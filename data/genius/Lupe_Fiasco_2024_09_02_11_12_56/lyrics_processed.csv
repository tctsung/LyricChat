<Lyric> 
We're all chemicals, vitamins, and minerals
And vicodin with inner tubes wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'?
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling
That's buried living
And cherry-picking every lemon from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother Hurl
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips?
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks?
And smells like shotguns and deer piss?
They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
From Popular Mechanics to overdosing heart/hard
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the wordplay ain't playing that the man's states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weathermen
Or maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not ?œrain??like ?œRain Man??or rain like ?œrain dance??Or rain like a ?œslight chance of rain??when it's rainin??Or ?œrein??like deer slaves to Santa Claus; sleigh man
But ?œreign??like queens that reign over made man
And not ?œQueen??like ?œQueen Killer; Rhapsody Bohem?™â€?Queen
But ?œqueen??like white-glove-wave-hand
And not ?œwave hand,??like it's a heat
Wave, so you make a fan by waving your hand
I'm talking ?œwave,??like you saying, ""Hey, man!""
And not hay for horses or ""hoarsest"" like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting that I was poor, but now I'm more than
It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops
Deep plots, in floor to ceiling windows for my pee pots
A little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop
And fan out like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise when the beat drop, and the sun dies when the beat stops...
Then it unties, then it relocks, then it relapse, then it detox
Then heat back like a heat pack on his knee caps of the weak spot
'Cause he want what we got, like yeah",Lupe Fiasco|||Mural|||0,0,
Lupe Fiasco|||Mural|||0|||1,Lupe Fiasco,Mural,"Then forge poetry, like a young ornery Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots, who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching nor sorbet-y
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer of sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
Or more torturing, a water-boarding Barbie doll
A river of women like Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of Barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's
Homie, if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets, down at Mardi Gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My rap position was black condition and activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they not apt to listen, unless it's dropping on Activision
Are we apps, or are we bodies filled with apparitions?
Operating applications, stuck inside of Apple prison
Chicken hackin??download updates that lack religion
Or are we more...
...Than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing, and foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings
Uhhh! Ain't nothin' to it, but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that, unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary, to a clitoris
The water bearer, heir of traditions, that I swear to never change
My chair position or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves out the mothafuckin' forest
As I perform a nerd storm, I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures, like Kool-Aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration
So that's OJ da Juiceman, meets OJ with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug, to judge who was, who drew blood
And, Lupe look at all these toucans, in a cemetery full of tomahawks
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colony, flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs, on the desert floor
Levitating youths, who know the truth of where the fountain hides
Buckaroo roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
A thousand parts, a pound of heart, an ounce of eyes
Announcing now, the doubt in mouth, pronounces out a count of lies
Chocula Counts by the count of five
Refrigerator roof, full of animals and monsters
Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat Konami sign contract
Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago, spray gun aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions isn't Chicano
Who?™s the Boss? If it isn't Alyssa Milano
Dudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives
Sub-zero, Gaiden, hiding, Raiden in the pack as well
Sound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
Dodging Rain and catching hail
Faith seers need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Filet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
Yeah, I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness
Real Steel til' he realize his realness
Defeat Samsara, achieves nirvana and brilliance
Yeah!

And a song comes on and a not far off from being born

Now, I ain't trying to make it too complex
But let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women these days
His mama sings along, and this what she says
""Niggas, I'm a bad bitch, and I'm bad, bitch!
Somethin' that's far above average.""
And maybe other rhyming words like ""cabbage"" and ""savage""
And ""baby carriage"" and other things that match it

They're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored
A complicated combination, maybe with no relevance
Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference

Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp

And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually

Ghost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
Say everything's hostile, suicide bombers
And prosperity gospels, emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils
They got to, just to stay awake
On the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels, and a handbag
Crucifixes, racism, and a land grab
Katrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cause a nine-stripper mad dash
A friend request, follow, and a hashtag
Now everybody want it like the last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class

Warden told the boy he better calm down
Step back from the brink and put the bomb down
But how the whole world in your palm sound?
It's why they treat niggas like shit
Writing raps to the taps
Keep the face mask on 'em, these niggas might spit

Any love less than unconditional is so
Under-Christian, it's unrepentant
The physical part of my church
Emits the invisible arts of my work
To make gold from garbage
Is not the alchemical point of this math
But truth be told it's the pursuit of gold
That turns the goal of men into trash
The soul's gold and they turning gold into cash
And your reflection is your connection
To more collections of more directions and paths
If your reflection is a mask, then you're reflective of mass
To see yourself just look at me then split your reflection in half

And it's so clean, pine trees smelling good
With work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood

As long as they look good when they be doing bad
Then the separation from the truth is getting vast, fast
Be a slave at first or free at last
Double-edged choices make a nigga wanna pass
Double-headed voices from the eagle on the staff
The pyramid where eyes will split the spirited in half
Divided over money
Delighted by the dummying down of the importance of crowns we'll never have
That's why my sounds and sermons are so full of wrath
Baptize your mind, let your brain take a bath
Swim inside the river, get delivered from the craft
Of the witches in this business that be living off your sad

Dis nigga, like he's so exclusive
Sometimes dreams, peace of paper I got reams
Where the D go?, Put that on a rose now you
Pronounce it hero, you see?
Lu see like La Brea & Pico, with binoculars on my peephole
I feel my best work was album zero
Now with Deniro its boo boo in my backyard and
Ben burnt down my gazebo that dinero's a casino
Wit spit in the sandwich of the police though
They ain't see the steel plate up under my seat though
Still play it like Shaquille but I can free throw
I ain't playing but I compete, I ain't a player but I'm complete
And that's the win win a mason mind can't sign if the pen's Templar
Night vision on white linen is still green
Peace of Paper I got reams, make it rain
To make em smile, now rake it into piles
And go buy ya self some style, prom night/cat walk
Prepared the suit for weeks, or effortless as a Parisian
Walking down the street, I ain't in it
I'm just walking round some beats
Tongue in cheek, just talking round some teeth
Neighborhood watching
Made of good options, mastermind times
Neighborhood hoodie take the hood shopping
Back track to the stolen plates
What's a closed wallet to an open safe
Say your grace
Peace of Paper/Cup of Jayzus what we writing?
These ain't entendres these are secret indictments
Litte secret excitements
For willing minds I'm feeling fine
Balling hard and killing rhymes
Knocking off bigs and stealing shines
Hey shawty is it a crime?
To DMV everytime until I give em license
They waiting on lines
Peace of Paper I'm Kerry James
Commissions fly as the Constitution as a plane
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS what we doing?
Pizza Lasers/ Cup of Razors
What you choosing?
Choosy mothers choose the smoothest peanut butters
And more cognizant fathers do George Washington Carver
A break from the paper it means do you identify more
With what's being made or the maker?
I'm what's being chased
I'm not the chaser
Cup of JAYZUS Peace of Paper
Check it, now paper make a plane & paper make it rain
But how fly is paper plane in the rain?
I'm fly paper on the brain
This and two-ply paper just ain't the same
I do do it for the bottom
In the air is where I stop em
I threw words like 2 birds, that's Batman and Robin
To answer all your hunches that's just how I throw my punches
We must somehow become a family that's why I throw 'em in bunches
Mushroom clouds or on the flo' with the fungus
If you look em up and down
From the foot to where he put his crown
The slow Pan to understand is Shaq on the shoulders of Yao
Over and over for miles
Peace of Paper, Cup of JAYZUS made a movie
Thank God on Friday, then buy a ruby on Tuesday
A couple beats from Jay, a couple beats from Ye
& make Food for thought, that's a restaurant in a day!
It would behoove thee
The critics say that I fell off I acknowledge I slipped
But what do you call falling from space into a bottomless pit?
And not pit like how Lui Kang can knock Baraka off with a hit
Knock it off for a bit
What would be really funny if I blew up after Drizzy
And started from the bottomless back to the topless like a watcher of Strips
Peace of Paper, Cup of JAYZUS
Peace of Paper, Cup of JAYZUS, bout it, bout it
Don't let ya inner fears result in a outer coward
From baby showers to 80 flowers upon my coffin roof
The upper class glass is not filled up with the coughing proof
Be more P and step ya Yessirs Up
P-O-P! Jayzus a cup of Courage, I can't can't
Thats double negative it's 2 earls
They really nice but they'll never touch the cup its like I gave it to two girls
This my odd future out in front Supreme shop
Fly as Rick Ross at a Wing Stop
Thought Kick Push was about drugs
It's not but just to be super sure
But from your perspective it might seem
Like Supreme out in front of Odd Future Store
So that skaters and skiers
Nose grinders and grinding up
Nose powders with ether
Not an Earl diss either but he might think it be and be like
""Lu's new should be Mr.Pure 2positive Shakur and 2 be sure he's
Not that really nice, That 2 girls and cup line sucked
It really means he gave himself a cup twice""
You just witnessed a double, a probable Odd Future diss in the future
And me ghostwriting my own rebuttals
You can't do that with a single cup
You gone need a couple, again you got a double
Got my shot on the rocks, but don't stop, keep pouring til it's a puddle
Peace of Paper, Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS what's the drive?
Greatest Rapper Alive or Greatest Rapper That Died?
Then on judgement day they say the greatest rapper's revived
Oh look who's here the greatest rapper's arrived!!
At the birthday party the greatest rapper surprised!!!
Bumped into Doom the greatest rappers collide
Everybody dead but AZ the greatest rapper survived
I'm not the greatest rapper... the greatest rappers' a lie
Got the same points as Lux the greatest rappers a tie
Told Jean, Foxy, & Rah the greatest rapper's a girl
They said the greatest rapper's a guy

They still trying to step inside ya prints
Bear trap rap don't step inside the clinch
Where da at? Don't jeopardize a better stride for limps
I exercise at length so electrify the fence
Let me inside the danger room on level 5 with the weaponized defense
With an extra side of the next guy's petty exercise attempts
The ghost of my career, better than most of what they revere
I take my targets and throw them back on my spear

Refine the receiver and plant it
During the panic and short it, it reports back

Everything is dying, everything is a rule
Everything is a crime, everything was here then
Everything rewind the new
Weather burned the feathers off everything flying

The lavish, the fastest, the clashes, the ashes to ashes

Once caught her changing the batteries in her halo
Receipt for her wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those

A society at peace. With liberty and justice for all
Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall
They would doubt that there was any starvation at all
That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved
From the sheer amount of paper, most likely used for trade

As they love my darkness, I make them heartless
And in return they have become my martyrs
I've been in the poem of many a poet
And I reside in the art of many a artist

My whole part in this, but they're fruitless in their harvest
The dro grows from my footsteps
I'm the one that they follow, I am the one that they march with

The Oval offices, crack houses, and apartments
Through the mazes of the queens
The pages of the sages and the chambers of the kings

One of the oldest, most ancientest things
Speak every single language on the planet, ya'n mean?

The rape of Africa, the undying machine
The overpriced medicine, the murderous regime
The tough guy's front and the one behind the scenes

I am the blood of this city, its gas, water, and electricity
I'm its gym, and its math, and its history
The gunshots in the class
And you can't pass if you missin', G

I taught them aim for the head and hope they never come back
I'm glad your daddy's gone, baby, hope he never comes back
I hope he's with your mother with my hustlers high in my traps

I hope you die in his trash
I can't help it, all I hear when you crying is laughs
I'm sure somebody find you tied up in this bag
Behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had
(Let me put you on game)
Then maybe you can grow up and be a stripper
A welfare-receiving prostitute and gold digger
You can watch on TV how they should properly depict you
The rivers shall flow with liquor, quench your thirst on my elixirs
(Let me put you on game)
I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
The trusted misleader, the number one defender
And from a throne of their bones I rule
These fools are my fuel, so I make them cool
(Let me put you on game)
Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool
And feed them from the table that held Corleone's food
If you die, tell them that you played my game

Steady as the medley booms from the Akai
Affirm as in ""Aye aye""

Like a observe from the view of a bird as it fly high
Sitting heavy like spaghetti in the belly of a wise guy

Most Manilla were manufactured in England or France
And like trade beads, were used for trades with Africa
The local chiefs on the slave coast of West Africa traded their human cargo
For many different commodities and the Manilla was one of them
This Manilla was manufactured in Birmingham between 1830 and 1850
Was being shipped to Africa to be bartered for one slave, each Manilla
These slaves were then packed into hulls of ships
And taken to the West Indies and the Americas
To be sold for vast profits if they did not die from the journey

<Lyric> 
Holy assumption of man into the heaven's sphere
Many mansions fit champions within its seven tiers
Evangelists re-imagine every 11 years
Pause for applause, evolves to what was never here
Born to death, born to die
Form the flesh, form the eyes
A veritable storm of winged forms swarms the skies
Marital norms unperformed but the porn survives
In the dorms of the scorn, they keep warm supplies
Gone to lose the use of tooth, horn and thigh
Before I was standing, I was landing
Two one-hand, one-man bands jamming in tandem
He who power naps, then plans gathering ransoms
And maps man's laps in a hand lathered in absinthe
Got a talent trafficking ramblings
And handing out amazing handmade maps of the labyrinth
Out the back of the wagon, out the back of the madam
Out the back of the Magnum, then out the trap of enchantment
Bellerophon with a megaphone, Mega Man
Desert zone, run marathons with sweaters on (sweaters on)
That was so simple but hot
In a place where it's so simple but not
Closed temples and old little forgots
And rode whole chisels, cripples who won't miss a salat
The old hoes that they won't give you a shot
But you can get the whole  pistol, it's gon' hit you a lot
These are real words from a savage mind
Unmaximized man on an average climb
Who don't deserve the whole truth and only half your time
Fit the life of a whole booth in only half a line
In the future life, I don't even have to rhyme
We'll get the entire Armageddon with only half the signs
Just yields and rail roads
In lush fields with bell tolls
Couple huddles of the unskilled but well told
It's unreal how off one deal to sell souls
And he got 'em by the dozen
Medulla oblongata is what got them by the oven
Like how the moonshine is what got him by the cousin
He got her by the bottom and he 'bout to stick his tongue in
Such an unsettling scene
An obscene setting for the unwedding of rings
The sharpest dresser at the unheading of queens
The architecture is something you've never seen
Dream clean, that's three words at the same time
And killed three birds with the same--
And won each and every hand with the same bluff and
Answers each and every man with the same question
What is it? But you still wanna know but I already done did it
I ball heavy, the physics
It's all, but it's already specific
If we doing what's already done, that means it's already terrific
That's rather meta-poetic, and just to acknowledge that
As an extra exhibit to what's already within it
The galleries lack the wall space
So I made a gallery of galleries, made of all space
If it was more small, it would be Moore's Law
From the land of the po' where we war, saw
From the hand of a pro to a whore jaw
Make her stand at the store 'til the snow thaw
Went from paper boy to editor
From throwing Ars Poetica with the arms of Federer
On the porches and steps to the farm houses of settlers
One of several sects who can come and charm the predators
We who measure the measuring tools of measurers
We who pleasure the pleasure tubes of pleasurers
We who lecture at treasured schools of lecturers
We who question the treasured rules of leveragers
Born to death, born to die
Mourn correct: immortalize
In a war, where your performance score is your salary
It's like fantasies combating your mortality
I'm just trying to restore sanity
Sigmund Freud boy, Leroy to your Vanity
To instill what kills krill destroys manatee
So heels spill but still seal deals that build factories
What looks Roman senator inner reveals Maccabees
Never just trust off guts, but what's actually
Unless it's Kuato's
Now, we back to pillars of salt, I recall back peeling potatoes
In hindsight, maybe attack of killer tomatoes
A seasoned shoulder's carrying plenty Pentium payloads
Now, that's another strata but I was making sense
Then cop out, took the highway and I was making chips
A nappy-head Karate Kid, I was breaking bricks
Can fight like Tekken 5, even taking 6
This rehabilitation, I be taking trips
""Don't Ruin Us"" God said, I won't make a dent
Hardly, but I'm still Harvey, I hope this making sense
Devil tooting his own horn, don't come and take a sniff
In the streets you gotta fight, you get punished for taking whiffs
To make that change for your team, you gotta have New Jersey Drive and a stomach for taking whips
I'm just trying to redeem
With these hands full of bars, don't beat me for coming clean
To unify the hooks, if you know it, then come and sing
Don't bust in while I'm asleep, nightmares who come in dreams
Samurais rarely die from another sword
This is 1985 meets the hover board
That was Bobby Johnson potato, just to underscore

All things gravy, greatest fear to let the groove slip
Always tell the masses that it's never gon' stop
Cause you never gon' do shit
Magnify justice over long lost blues riffs
Mop up, sop up the tears for fears with a Q-tip
They proceeds to poke out they eyes with a toothpick
Remember when Larenz Tate beat Terrence with the pool stick
Or when Caine pistol whipped Chauncy and that fool snitched
Sent the tape to Bill Duke, would've went to jail
If he wouldn't have got killed in that drive-by by the dude he kicked
Cuz he was like, ""It ain't mine""

And wan' it funny when they caught T-Bone, dancing with that rabbit
Didn't Rocket have the same gun that the old man shot OG Bobby Johnson's son in the back with
Or do I got it backwards

And Caine'd had a nigga's Daytons skatin' on his Mustang
'Member when the whole crowd stopped and got tense
Then they cheered when Steel put his hand up on the fence
Then when Gee Money first got married to the cocaine
And Chris Tucker OD'ed there watching Soul Train
Cam'ron shot him in the car and took his gold chain
Nino was free till he met up with that old man
Ice-T was there and he oversaw the whole thing
Mello lost his legs just to get up out the dope game
Why he throw his gun into the river, though?
Just to hit the roof to get the juice and let Bishop go
Show Hodges love, but the Pac Man day came
'Specially after sprayed the little ese with the spray paint
'Member when Bobby took off his tear

At my brother's Janazah
Tears stained sunglassses
A Salat with no bows
Pallbearer carry you to the car now
Chilly day, Mosque on 96 and 3rd
New York City way, me and Jay never left my side
Rest like that picture with your pride
Who look just like..
Now the city looks less bright
Brooklyn looking less special
Don't carry the same weight
As when you were on this level
You: work in progress from 40 projects, God bless
An inspiration and a king

And what my cold war is
Cause the complexity is enormous
Using one of my greatest losses with eyes like faucets
To reinforce every single word that I talk with
Something about losing things, human beings
That reduces things to their most elementary
Find yourself where you never meant to be
With the energy of memories
That's the soul force of what's behind killing me
Finding pleasure in the pains
Like finding desert in the rain
Twisted: how this world can drive you masochistic
Question if I'm over it
Or if I'm numb because I'm closureless
Or my closure's that we all gotta go and shit
Rendered emotionless but moving at the speed of running over it
Still happy that I opened it",Lupe Fiasco|||Cold War|||59,2,

In memorial of my brother
As you listen to the album with
Nothing on the cover
I imagine that he hovers
Right in the back of this chair
Floating right there in the air
Nodding his head to the music, I slightly lose it
Ask why do I put myself through this
Crack a smile, look up at the file
The waveforms on the screen of me tryna tell you what I mean
But I feel that it's all lost, or maybe that it's all gotta cross
Happy with his dedicated song
But now he's all gone
But he was never there, cause
He was everywhere, nowhere and down here
Maybe on that judgement day, rise up
We'll both open our eyes up, climb up
Hoping God forgives us for our tendencies
Wipes away our cool young histories",Lupe Fiasco|||Cold War|||59,3,

All over the world right? I mean, everywhere

I feel like we can just put him anywhere
He'd find his way back home, y'know'm saying
Another random thing's that consequence to me
But maybe to you, not much
But with that said, the reason behind me
Why I do what I does, love
Just riding around bumping that, uh
Either Jay or Nas, or me
He used to tell em like ""yeah you alright""
But you ain't fucking with my man
It was always like that, so
Drop a little for you, let it bump
This that Esco music, it's that Esco music
Bumping with my Esco music, that raw
See you on the other side, As-Salamu Alaykum

You ain't really died and we watched you grow up
At 12 months you took your first steps
Awkwardly across the kitchen floor to your best
Your first breaths that we can call words
Were in your father's lap on November 23rd
And they were, ""Live for me"", and he did for you
Flipped to Neutron and stayed inside the crib for you
And this commitment from your father
Imparted a deep sense of value you forever harbor
We were all so proud as we seen you getting smarter
And the bond grow deeper between a mother and a daughter
'Cause you were not a martyr

At seven, you knew how a brain looked
And could roughly describe, all the different regions
Could tell when we was sick and even knew the reason
The world wasn't at peace, gunfire every weekend
But you were hardly there, cause you was always leaving
Field museum, planetarium, aquarium
You saw something special in that tank you were starin' in
And in those moments, as a little girl
You realized there was a bigger world
Bigger than the South Side, bigger than Chicago
You were bigger, still wanted rims on your car though
And big ass woofers in your car door
So you could wang like your daddy at the park eating sharks
Went to King where you were teased for being smart
Where you bumped into Hadiya teaching art
You live forever",Lupe Fiasco|||Jonylah Forever|||63,3,

At twenty-two is when you got your doctorate
Even now it's kind of hard to believe
But your father taught you work hard, and achieve
And you complied
Accepted by every medical school you applied
But the coolest thing is when they offered you that high paying slot, you replied
""They need me in the hood,"" and that's where you reside
Free clinic, nobody denied
And that's where you heard the shots and quickly ran outside
And saw a man and a van and a bleeding baby in his hands
Fading fast, but you knew she could survive
Did everything you could to keep this girl alive
Stabilized until the ambulance arrived
And in that moment, where you gave your help
I bet you didn't know that you saved yourself",Lupe Fiasco|||Jonylah Forever|||63,5,

Bury your doubts and fall asleep

Not at all bothered with what a sodomite see, flippant

Taught me that sharin's carin' so I spread the bread out
That's what I need
To get in heaven that's when I bleed, get in hell when I breathe...
Get it? Inhale, when I breathe
Maybe you'll get it when I bereave, there's levels to this shit
And there's devils on the level of this bitch

Hello Gorgeous
This phone call's probably being recorded
Just know that I did it for the four of us
And those motherfuckers kept ignorin' us
After this I'm going underground
If they come asking give them the run-around
How does Costa Rica in the summer sound?
Couple days then we moving to another town
Yea I know them dreams, seams
Just know that time'll never come between
Space either, fake features
Things that we reject but connects all us believers
The insurrection's gone viral
They'll never stop it now, I hope it all spirals
Outta control, like a dam with a hole
From here on out it's all about survival
The way we left things they probably think we rivals
But don't be naive, they hate you more than I do
Remember always speak in opposites
I hate you so much, it's such a compliment
I know that defies the common sense
But we ain't never been right: honestness
We never fit in school, and never did rules

Of them fighting our water with fire
He said that we need something drier
To really impress the empire
Funny cause he really hated war
But why we went to war is what he really hated more
Said it's silly how that our schools make us stupid and our jobs make us poor
When he came back from the Corps
Is when he really got serious
Read a lot of books, started acting all mysterious
The VA is what really made him furious
Told him his condition didn't exist, period
That's why he started that petition
Went all the way to Washington, said they didn't listen
To a white male Christian
He just laughed when they took our father's pension
He said that you gotta act in opposites
Helps you hide your tracks when you stand up to the dominant
But I knew he felt bad
Told me later was the saddest day he ever had
To see our dad so hopeless
That was the turning point that's what really gave him focus
I didn't agree with everything, some of it made sense

Everybody, everywhere is calling you a hero
They going through the rubble, but the body count is zero

Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul

Self-absorbed with his own self-forfeit
A shelf full of awards
Worshiping the warships that set sail on my sea of life
When I see my old self I wonder if we still see alike
We was tight seeing lights, speaking right and breathing life
Now I see my demons and barely even sleep at night
I don't get high, life keep me at a decent height
As the old me I predicted all my recent plights
Exhausted, trying to fall asleep, lost inside my recent fights
Burdens on my shoulders now, burnin' all my motives down
Inspiration drying up, motivation slowing down",Lupe Fiasco|||Letting Go|||70,1,

To never go our separate ways and spin-off into separate shows
Tired of all the wardrobe changin', playing all these extra roles
Filled with all these different spirits, livin' off these separate souls
Point in life is getting hollow, can't wait for the exit hole
Give me room the entry wound, let me in and let me go
So I can roam around this wilderness
See it for what it really is, unprepared and filterless
Magnify the youth in me, alibi the shootin' spree
Amplify the revolution, sanitize the lunacy
Strip away the justice, justify the scrutiny
I can see the lasers, shootin' out of you and me",Lupe Fiasco|||Letting Go|||70,2,

Is against me
And everything that I've done before
I swear we used to be so pure
But we can't be in love no more
'Cause I don't wanna fight this war
But when I put down my gun
I turn around and pick up one
This Uzi weighs a ton
But I think I'm done",Lupe Fiasco|||Letting Go|||70,3,

""If you had to paint the gutter, which color would you choose?""
Said the patron to the painter, the painter said, ""The blues""
""Do you act off intuition or languish and peruse?""
""More like tap into tradition from the angle of my mood""
He looked back at his canvas while strangling a tube
A master of the palette, all sanguine and cool
The music mostly jazz, the jazz mostly old
Punctured by some punk and some old smoky soul
An atlas on the trunk from the land of broken goals
Just a cover and a back that you open and you close
""Where are all the pages?"" The paintÐµr said, defanged
""I ripped 'Ðµm all out and made some paper planes
Fish grease absorbers and some origami cranes??Poured hisself a drink and then poured it down the drain
Looked at the empty canvas, said ""I think I have a name
I'll call it 'Gasoline Pouring on the Flames,'"" hah, hah",Lupe Fiasco|||MS. MURAL|||73,0,
Lupe Fiasco|||MS. MURAL|||73|||1,Lupe Fiasco,MS. MURAL,"""I appreciate the visit, this isn't normally allowed""
""Do you consider yourself wild or conforming to a style?""
The patron pointed at a pile, ""Are those rejections or mistakes?""
The painter said, ""That is not for question or debate
Most of what we know as art is the projection of a faith
The product of a Pontiff or the election of a saint
A gift from the read for the digestion of the can't
A visual garnish for the confessions of the frank
Displays of physical carnage make connections to the ranks
Goes over very well with South Americans and Yanks
Not to sound shamanistic, but there's medicine in paint
It gets kinetic if you let it, there's a fetish in its strength
Martyrdom will call, Russian roulette is in the flanks
And most would pull the trigger if the weapon's full of blanks
But when there's a pool of sharks and you step into the tank
That's the pool of art that got 'em headed to the plank
But they fell for the deceptiveness of the secularist's complaint
The upheaval of the cathedral into the edifice of bank
That pile over there is just the evidence of angst
The failed revival of a perfectionist when his efforts have just sank
A selection of the waste that lacks direction or a base
You lose all of the plots for the affections of a race
Man does not become superior 'cause you connect him to a cape
Nor does become inferior because you connect him to a ape
I never wanted my life to be a collection of some dates
And holiday my days away and intellectually sedate
It's not really a beef but conceptually it's steak
Like do genitals and gender roles successfully conflate?
The current art world is just competitively opaque
It never ceases to amaze, my mouth is medically agape
One day its raising up the brand, the next it's shredding it to flakes
And the velocity of trends is what referees the pace
Professionally accept what ethically I hate
So in all of my work, you see this wrestling with fate
Deceiving in the brushstrokes how aggressively I strafe
Less like putting on some makeup, more like severing a face""
""Wow,"" said the patron with a smile
""That's the most interesting diatribe I've heard in a while
How you articulated the nature and put it all on trial
Took it up to Heaven, then put it on the ground""
The painter asked the patron, ""Can you stand up on the pile?
I've had a flash of inspiration, my creativeness aroused""

Lord have Murcielagos waiting on the nigga
At the end when the time come
Get the drop on the weed spot
Like there's too much water in the tea pot, huh
Lord have Murcielagos on the poor, nigga, pour, nigga
They adore the event of war
Down force on the doors of adored niggas
Does the Lord like to thank award winners?
And the war winners'll rewards inner
Or the all-enders ain't the pure chemists
So the form in this can be raw in this like the porn business
Keen to king 'til the, 'til the pawn hit us
If he goes, half a million sold, sold the soul, going gold
In the end will it go to the pawn business?
You ain't doing nothing with it
Let a nigga get it for the low-low-low-low
Lames tried to form it, brains couldn't storm it like a Ororo-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro
In the Philippines eating chicken wings, smothered with adobo-dobo-dobo-do
Vatos, fiascos, vocos locos like a cho-lo-lo-lo

Santa ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, K-Ci, Jo-Jo-Jo-Jo-Jo
Brown skin brother in a fed box at the hell lil' nigga live there for months
Except these young, black males wouldn't drive if you give them trucks
Nigga, nigga, nigga what, I don't give a, give a, give a, fuck

The verbiage gets merciless this wordsmithness just rolls
I've tuned into my pertinence, my purposes, my goals
The feeling when you realize you've been working for your foes
And the curtains have just opened and they worthlessness exposed
You remember where you came from, where the purchases was stole

And I SCUBA'd way down low
Put the top down on my fears
Put the roof up on my woes

And I still feel like a virgin me versus the globe
From the surface to the core
I took on the biggest wave
And I surfed it to the shore with no pomade in my fro
Took the wood from the slave ships and furnished my abode

Underdogs of the past can be the shit up in the future
I brush my shoulders off to remove my bazooka
What we doing? Deck full of spades, hold a mic like Bob Barker
It's manure if you new to the ways of the lupester
The base meaning is I'm a roofer, (woo!), I'm going like fuschia
All I need is a coup and a princess behind me like King Koopa
If a nigga with me and he black he might shoot ya
And that's motherfuckin real, even my mother, is fucking, real
Kitchen counter tapping then undercover skills
Your beat is in my bedroom giving head to 'em
Stretch it out, stand up in it and call it leg room
Beat the beat till it's beat there's eggs to 'em
Then repeat, eat it till it sleep, then wake it up
But then don't speak to it cause now it's like the feds to 'em
Beats having trouble going to sleep cause now I'm like Fred to 'em
And if I can be any meaner, our patina was Martin and Gina
To her I would have ran, but now she like Pam
She still want the flow but now I'm like damn
Whisk her away, but I had to scram back to the bullshit
Scramble to ya pulpits and tell the preacher he legit
Beats get weaker the deeper that I get
Damn right she ain't even get the shaft, I'm just speaking from the tip
When the fire gone then I quit, cellphone still along on the trip
So I can speak to the choir from the throne on my ship
And noble or sober or my song nobler
Eating with our hands and the waiter is a fan
Shout out to Mike Ferro keeping paper in my hands
Tailored Savile Row, or Mastermind Japan
Sky dropped six on the blazer
Drop top Aston versus Cobra, I'mma race ya
Free Rico, before he do his bid
Got a father tatted on him, gone show him where it is

I ain't never lectured you, I get energetic and joke
But in real talk, nigga, I ain't never disrespected you
I'ma punch you in your fucking face and we all think it's silly
I'm thinking like ""Won't this bitch nigga clean up his fucking city?""
I mean you got all of the clout, know how to bring all them niggas out
You can walk the walk, I mean, we seen you walk all over your house
But me and Mickey is geeks because you got some heat
Like I didn't go to the closet and put guns all over the couch

I spit your verse to get immersed inside my enemy
And to remind you they got to go through you just to get to me

Now that I think about it, that's kind of half-and-half
If a nigga asked you for the strap, why would you keep it in the stash?
If you ran the world, we'd get defeated in a flash
You really gonna be the boss, can't keep secrets from the staff
I learned that in the streets, nigga sweeping trash
Keeping my city clean while you was talking 'bout beating a nigga's ass
That shit is wack, long live backpack rap
Fuck these Monster-drinking, new-age conscious-thinking
Farrakhan today, gangster tomorrow
One foot in they sorrow, another foot in the trap
Killers who easily triggered by a little nigga's attacks
Who have the audacity to ask rappers to rap

Food and liquor stores rest on every corner
From 45th and State to the last standing Henry Horner
J&J's, Harold's Chicken, good finger lickin'
While they sin, gin, sin sin at Rothschild's and Kenwood Liquors
The winos crooked stagger meets the high stride of the youth
Searchin' for the truth
They rebel and raise hell across alleyways and in classroom settings
They get, high off that trunk bass and 20/20 rims
They rock braids, Air Force Ones, and Timbs
They drink Hennessy, Hypnotiq, and 40's
They call they women hoes, bust downs, and shorties
They keep funeral homes in business and gunshot wards of hospitals full
Prisons packed, bubblin' over in brown sugar
They keep empty, Westside lots crowded, hype's powdered
The well is running dry
The days of Malcolm and Martin have ended
Our hope has descended and off to the side
Waiting for the reinstallment of the revolution
Because we are dying at the cost of our own pollution
But God has another solution, that has evolved from the hood
I present one who turns, the Fiasco to good",Lupe Fiasco|||Intro|||99,0,

You got your food, and your liquor

Teddy bear, liquor bottle shrines, rocks
Tanks, prayer rugs, church pews, Mexican corn stands
Blood, sweat, and tears, police batons
Gas masks and bullets create graffiti on corners
Murals that salute freedom or death for liberty
Be it Englewood or Egypt, Bedstuy or Baghdad
Syria or Liberia, the west bank or the west side of Chicago
Where food and liquor stores still occupy the block
While police and community watchmen justify why they shot
Emmit Till and Malice Green, Rekia Boyd and Trayvon Martin
Better not wear that hoodie while shopping for a carton

Cause your soul is dessert and will be dissected and consumed
On the Fox evening news while we sing the blues
The New Jim Crow caged bird sings
Cause he?™s tired of occupying his misery and of our marching
He wanna fly to a higher consciousness
But his school on academic probation

And two weeks later it?™s back to normal

People carrying torches, hope burning from their hands
Attaching explosive devices ?˜cause they keep stealing their lands

Peace, no material possessions shall cloud my judgement
As I reach, in an ethereal direction to provide my substance
Love is not found but resides insides me, I manifest this
I will respect myself and wear serenity as my necklace
I will replace what I take and have tranquility as my breakfast
Shed a new light on a new path
I will gain rhythm and lose wrath, attain wisdom and refuse graft
And build upon what I built on and wisely regulate time I do have
Cause what is defeat? But just the evidence of my haste
Lack of preparedness, in my waste, so I wait
Surround myself with nutrition, wholesomeness and true livin'
Use natural codes of conduct to remove schism when the rules missin'
I will pursue felicity, find value in simplicity
Altruism and empathy will be the first thing extended to my enemy
Clarity will be the trademark of my friendships

Forced to repeat the same dumb shit that work
Only as hot as your last beat
And rappers, they relating to that last piece
Album never leave they desk if you don't got no B.D.S
Sacrifice your publishin', they said you really need a hook
And they ain't gon' pay you, said that you received a look
And what's stupid real, is what producers feel
Twenty placements or you stuck in that producer deal
And R&B chicks so get it the wildest
All they money goes to hairdressers and stylists
Gotta keep up with that image
Label lose they mind if they ever see a blemish
ProActiv and peels, airbrushers and trainers
Managers suggest you fuck a nigga to be famous, huh
But it's all entertainment
Wonder when Cobain blew out his brains, did he blame it?
And if those snakes in the industry helped him aim it
Started pressing up records before the bullet left the chamber
I fight evil, everyday I'm livin'
Rest in peace to men, women and the children
And middle fingers to the Pilgrims that killed 'em
Friend of the People, happy Thanksgiving

War gives value to life by showing it can be taken away
And in a perverted way, those who wage war delude themselves into thinking they create life

Thus, using that as a basis for grandiose notions of supremacy
Falsely giving themselves the title of masters of the universe

Followed by a fat man who left behind a leveled earth

<Artist name> Lupe Fiasco <\Artist>
<Song title> DETAILED EXPLANATION OF LUPE FIASCO?™S TETSUO & YOUTH <\Song title>
<Lyric> 
--- After listening to Lupe?™s new album, Tetsuo & Youth, multiple times, I specifically want to begin this analysis by getting into the album?™s last portion which ran from the season of Winter to Spring. Note that there is a lot of religious content that was referenced in this time period; I will get into all that later
--- The season started with ?œChopper??and a lot of people are wondering why a song like ""Chopper"" is on the album. Well, you can't just get into a song like ""Deliver"" without giving an example of WHY the pizza man won't come to the ghetto. That is why ?œChopper"" is there. It's a hood ass trap song with features from rappers that purposefully spit their verses from the perspective of the killers, drug dealers, and the gangstas that live in the trap
--- Moving onto ?œDeliver,??like I said, this song shows the results of what went down in ?œChopper"" and the reasons behind not delivering pizza to the hood. If we look at the main line from the hook, ""Pizza man don?™t come here no more,??it contains a triple entendre: firstly, the forefront meaning is that the pizza can?™t be delivered to such dangerous locations; secondly, the PEACE-of man doesn?™t come there no more, and this is similar to the first meaning because there is violence that is preventing the pizza man from delivering the pizza; this all goes back to ?œChopper??and how the absence of peace stirs up the controversy; thirdly, the piece-of MAN doesn?™t come there no more. This one ties into the next song, ?œMadonna (And other mothers of the hood),??because the piece-of MAN not being there is referring to the father figures that are absent while their child grows up without them. With no father figure, the child will live his life without an example to follow or know what is right from wrong, so there are significant chances that he?™ll be sucked into the hood activities such as drug dealing and gang affiliations, which will eventually lead to the mother's concern for her child?™s well being
--- With all the information thus far, I think it?™s time to start pointing out some religious references. Firstly, Madonna in other words is another name for Virgin Mary, who was the mother of Jesus Christ who never had a blood related father. Similarly to how Mary feared Jesus?™s prosecution, the last thing that the mothers of the hood want are to see their sons die before their very eyes, but at the end of the song, referencing to the movie Boyz In Da Hood, the child lied dead in his mom?™s house just like Ricky in the movie, much like how Mary was in attendance at Jesus?™s crucifixion
--- The next song, ?œThe Adoration of the Magi,??contains a significant amount of video game references that foreshadow two things: The Game, and the next song which he appears in, ?œThey.Resurrect.Over.New."" This song is speaking about a Magi, or a king from old times. In this song, the Magi is played by The Game. For those who are not familiar with The Game's background, he can be described as someone that controls everything in the evilest of ways, and this song is almost a continuation of the song he appeared in from The Cool, ?œPut You On Game,??which was rapped primarily from The Game's perspective with lyrics from that song that go, ""I?™m sure somebody'll find you tied up in this bag behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had, then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper.??This song, ?œAdoration of the Magi??continues the baby theme in the chorus as it uses other artist?™s albums that had babies on the covers (Ready to Die, Carter 3, NWTS, Illmatic, etc.) to symbolize that they they are too young to be on a rap cover, but that is why the Game adores them so much and is interested in the youth. That is why he made his reappearance to this album because the main theme of the whole album is about our youth and that is who he is interested in (Which Lupe has stated numerous times in his interviews if people were wondering. That?™s where we get the title of the album with a little flair with Tetsuo in front of it). Towards the last line of this song, it becomes clear that the baby grew up to be a stripper just like The Game suggested and she is even having her own child too but doesn?™t know it; this is why she is wanted by the game, or ?œadored by the magi.??--- Religiously speaking, the Adoration of the Magi story has to do with the 3 western kings that lived centuries ago. They followed a star and found the whereabouts of Jesus where they presented him with gifts. This event happened on Jan. 6 which marks the same day Lupe released this song
--- Now that we have went over the 3 singles for this album (Madonna, Deliver, Adoration of the Magi), it?™s about the time we can discuss a vital point that Lupe tweeted, he said, ?œWhat if I told you that Madonna Delivered the Adoration of the Magi???Here?™s were things get even crazier. From a religious perspective, ""Madonna (Virgin Mary) Delivered the Adoration of The Magi (Jesus)."" If we look at the phrase from a hood perspective, he is saying, ?œMadonna (and other mothers of the hood) Delivered the Adoration of The Game (strippers, gangstas, drug dealers, killers).??--- Leading into the next song, They.Resurrect.Over.New. will probably have the listener wondering why there are so many video game references, well the answer is simple. If this album is about the Youth, then what other way would be better to portray The Game in front of the youth?™s eyes? To a grown man, The Game is the drug game, strip clubs, war zones, etc., but to a baby, The Game is just simply a video game to them. In this song, Lupe said things like ?œwe should be closer??and that is a direct message to the ghetto because his people are killing each other in there. Ab-Soul continues the Game theme by saying, ?œTrapped in a game where, the trap is The Game, yeah.??And the only way to get past The Game is to ?œProceed to the next level??which is telling the youth to not fall into the hands of The Game and end up as the killers that make up Chi-raq, or the strippers that make up the strip clubs, or the drug dealers that make up the drug game. Rather the point of proceeding to the next level is to break away from the shackles, or like Ab-Soul?™s last line, ?œUnloose the Noose.??That is the only way to crush the hood stereotypes
--- That is about it for the story, but there is still the concept of the seasons that go on throughout the album that seem really random. Lupe described them as palette cleaners to give the listener soothing breaks throughout the album, but it is even more. Notice how in winter, there are no kids on the streets and you get a chilly, eerie feeling from the sounds playing? That was the mood set for Chopper to symbolize that there are no kids on the street during that time. This is why Lupe wants his people to proceed to the next level so they can finally put an end to the violence that Choppers bring. That way the pizza man can Deliver to the hood again, the kids can play on The Streets again and ultimately, so The Game can be abolished. Why else would Lupe have a music video for Deliver where a kid has to go out of his way into a nice neighborhood to receive something that can't be brought to his parts? That is the lesson that Lupe is trying to teach. You can't just sit inside all day messing around with The 'Video' Game. You have to eventually get out so it won't end up controlling you, which is the true meaning of proceeding to the next level. In reference to pizza, you can't wait for things to be Delivered to you, sometimes you have to go out of your way to obtain them
--- Finally, we arrive at the last track of the album, Spring. This is an outro filled with cheers and fireworks that signify the end of a truly incredible album. If listened closely, the sounds of the kids can be heard once again meaning the violence has came to a halt. Obviously this is not the case in real life so could this be an alternate dimension where things are different? Furthermore, why are there no songs between Spring and Summer? When you go to repeat the album, it's like a whole chunk of it is missing. Did Lupe leave out a couple months on purpose? Maybe he is trying to say whatever takes place after Spring is for the youth to decide since they're the future. What they choose to do from there is up to them whether they want to stay in the ghetto forever or want to leave one day. It?™s up them to decide what happens next. On a side note, Lupe didn't want this album to have a deluxe version, maybe for the reason that it would divert the listeners attention from the inner meaning. He may have truly intended for there to be no song between Spring and Summer so the Deluxe users wouldn't replay the album and get distracted by the bonus tracks
--- Like Lupe said in his interview with Sway, it may take years upon years for this album concept to be fully digested and respected for what it is. He said it may even take 100 years, and here is the reason why. If this album is about the Youth growing up and the ghetto's making peace one day, then the day that happens will also be the same day Tetsuo & Youth will be looked at as a masterpiece. This was the point of the video for Deliver. That video summed up the whole entire album. Lupe was trying to show that unless true peace is formed among the ghettos, then that is the picture they'll be left with forever. It's practically asking the question, if you can't respect yourselves, how can you expect others to respect you? And it's not only them, the youth has to pay for their elders mistakes and the unfairness of not getting a pizza will fall upon them as a child, then other factors will eventually come into play like they'll quit going to school and they'll remain in the hood selling dope for their whole life, so the point is, until their role models can spark the change, the cycle will never end
---In conclusion, this was a summary of the last 5-7 tracks of Tetsuo & Youth. If you read this far, I hope you have a better understanding of the album's concept and the season?™s meaning and message.  #FNFUP #T&Y #DROGAS",Lupe Fiasco|||DETAILED EXPLANATION OF LUPE FIASCO?™S TETSUO & YOUTH|||112,0,

I was born in a small village
I was still a child when we were raided by soldiers
Foreign soldiers
Torn from my elders, I was made to speak their language
With each new post, my masters changed
Along with the words they made me speak
With each change, I changed too
My thoughts, personality, how I saw right and wrong
Words can kill
Time and again, the country was ruled by a foreign tongue
When he was a young boy, he lost his native language

Kinda throw me words slowly, fade degrading in the foley
Waving metal sheets make thunder
Fooling I was younger; fool me when I'm older
Fool me now, screw me down to the sofa, taking Soma
Drinking soda, eating vulture, tweeting vulgar
Playing Madden getting fat and getting cultured with the quotes

The black land swam at like a HE MAN in a bathtub

They roll rocks like asteroids to the crest
Think outside the box, I wrap a toy in a cheque
Then watch a sissy fuss with a boy in a dress
Mad at the world, in a voice of a man
With a bag of a girl, she just avoids the success
It's what he said, or what she said
Double entendre no matter how you play it
Then he takes the sex tape and destroys the cassette
And puts the ribbon in the sky like the limited of eye
Then prepares to utter, what's been a symbol in its side
Against the ticker tape scene in a Silver Lake dream
Sorta orders the lungs to unmilitate screams
Shouts to a forged son with imitate beams
In a blue sky filled with pornographic strings

But Carlyle said, um, that we could not be ruined
Because no lie could live forever
William Cullen Bryan said, ""Truth crushed to earth, would rise again""
And James Russell Lowell, made it more plain
That we would not be ruined or destroyed
Because he said that, ""Truth, forever on the scaffold, lies forever on the throne
But that scaffold sways the future, and behind the dim unknown
Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch, above his own""
These powerful scriptures were also used by the man
In whom we celebrate his birthday today, Dr. Martin Luther King
And Dr. King told us to practice non-violence and the power of love
Non-violence and the power of love has brought us thus far
The agape love that we have for ourselves
That we have for our people is the reason why our people
In this particular diaspora called, North America
Have not been totally ruined
We have not been totally destroyed, we have not been exterminated
So therefore, uh, my dear brother, um, Wasalu
We call you, we thank you for what you've asked me to do
And we shall continue to study to show ourselves approved under God
Workman that needn?™t not be ashamed
Rightly this dividing the word of truth
And so at this time, in this city
Where young men's lives are not worth much
In this city where our people have been discriminated against
And kept from the resources which we
Rightly deserve as a majority of people in the city
We are dependent upon the most high creator of the ends of the world
That I call Elohim Jehova
And we are dependent upon him to keep us from falling
To keep us from being ruined, to keep us from being exterminated
And we thank the Almighty
For the privilege of being here with my niece
Is to impart these words
And I hope it would be of assistance in this project
God bless you and thank you

Man, now ain't that cold
I'm just tryin' to talk to my homie that's up in the hole

I tell 'em, tell 'em, don't homicide me

Fightin' for his fans and fightin' for his folks

The giver of fame, the take awayer of lame
The empowerer of the kings that came with claims and disease
To leave where the native peoples were staying
Believe, my engagement ring received
And flossed at the cost of a bonded child miner's pain
Long ago kings used to wear 'em in their armor when they fought other armies
Because it used to scare 'em
If you wasn't rich, couldn't wear 'em

Into the countryside just to get his shine on
I fear what De Beers and his peers used to do
Before the world really knew, just to get their mine on
Making paper with slave labor
And hitting little kids with life time bids making them cut and shine stones
Inflating the price and making them look nice
And I wasn't thinking twice when I was putting mine on
About a young shorty in Sierra Leone
Or other conflict countries that people call home
I figured I would never go to Angola
So it never did affect me there, maybe indirectly
That my neck leash was funding a rebellion or a military coup
Started by militias that don't believe in following none of Geneva's rules
I was brushing off the haters, trying to be cool
Didn't have a clue that the rapper was helping the rapers
Raiders of the villagers, pillagers of the schools
Shooters of the innocents, torturers of the witnesses
Burners of the businesses and my bracelet was the fuel
Uh, I ain't pushing an agenda, homie
I'm just pushing the facts, fuck Bush
'Cause there's people doing worse on this earth and they're black
I took it there, yeah, now let me bring it back
We all know on foreign shores that they finance wars
But ask yourself, ""Do they finance yours?""
When I first got mine I took them out on tour
Didn't know they lost half the value when I took 'em out the store
Or it was full of moissanites and cubits
But the jeweler knew I was stupid
And that I couldn't prove it
Feeling like I need it because I do music
To impress the groupies and the interviewers
So I didn't appraise it, nor did I loupe it
Even gave them to my girl, thinking I was Cupid
Homies was all hate, hoping they could make me lose it
Creeping through my own hood, knew I had to remove it

The undercover terrorists and the traps for the hustlers

Still kinda paranoid from when they leaked my tape
Jeopardize being friendly just to keep mine safe

Can't be 21 every time I sit and make a verse
When I did that song with NumbaNine, I was tryna break the curse
The good don't make it out of the hood unless the hood make it out you first
All you needs just to believe that you can leave
Crown B and Es made me believe that I could lead
Righteous deeds, planting seeds for good society
So you see that I can't be totally new
Cause there's a future Lupe out there that wanna be both of me too
And nobody really knows what the future holds
All the future sins for our future souls
And what I am doing now I couldn't do before
What would you do, man, if you could go?

First step was out the front door then the first left
Down the block to the spots where the worst kept
Thirty years later got a thirty tier caper
To shoot up the scene and scheme
Plot, broken all down to two rounds of scotch
A pound means now and we too down to stop
Say ya got enough round for two thousand cops

He ever seen her before, her face don't connect
No, so keep it on the low, go
Seizes her by the arm
Looks right into the eyes cause these be the charms
Sheba, King Tut suite at the Khalifa
Tied to a chair getting burned by Cohibas
A well dressed thug who run clubs in the Koreas
The room smells like fresh hand made tortillas
He recognized the tattoos of a real big Maui brother
Known for bad news when his cash rules
Are you familiar with the shell of the cashews?
As he holds the needle up to the light bulb

Settling on debts with north Zanzibar
Your name's on the list, kitsch
A hundred million dollars worth of high grade fish
Tuna, Tokyo cartels worlds biggest consumer
A rumor bout a schooner off the coast of Montezuma
They say you slit the throat of a well known kahuna
Then torched the boat and fled into the Dunya
You?™re hated more than a Kalua pig at a Jumu'ah
They want your head on a platter, not right now but sooner

Then a zero to a hundred baby real quick
Look around the car for something else to kill with
Lamborghini headlights in the rear view
These Parisian streets not meant to veer through
Especially with just one hand
I let go to shoot back but the gun jams
Mitsubishi not built to outrun Lambs
So they gaining, heavy raining
Rear view explodes from deadly aiming
Arm paining, blood draining
Pains, head for the Louvre
Drive right through the glass pyramid with dope moves
A little shook from the landing
Driving through the Louvre in a rally car with great handling
Was at the Mona Lisa
Stop the car right in front of the Delacroix and have a breather
Press play on the radio, voice from the speaker
Says get to Belgrade and take an ad out in the daily Politika
They says for a good time call this Ecuador slash Venezuelan chica
Next day at the airport meeted by a greeter who looks Corsican but Greeker
A little older wearing Michael Jordan sneakers
But I follow the leader
1995 S. Class, in the back seat is a dead man whose car I just crashed
Smearcon's alive, audience now wonders how Smearcon survived
Let alone not be hurt, he taps a metal plate in his head from his Afghanistan work

Come, and bring the pieces to the master
He who organize by size then completes them with the plaster
Now, what should we call it?
After 12, cocktails prevails the inner alcoholic
Who knelt you by the toilets?
Remember, remember? Just like the Knights of Malta
Niggas like their liquor malted, manifested like a land without the Indian
Just all kith and foul kin
Whether Maltese or  Millennium
Saucer, Chaucer of the airwaves
Two assists: one Senegalese but her hair beige
The others hairs' shaved, both standing at the bottom of the staircase poised
But boys too coy to look in their face

Taught you well on how to tell the impostors
Made an inner city Mosque in Mississippi, Madrassas

All my skills on the hilltop, you can hear a quill drop
Spoon full of sugar help the pill pop
Let us Tetris, little blocks until the bill clots
And then fill spots and make the field drop

She said love is a hard thing
Somewhere between golfing and gardening
Or parole board pardoning
But she was still down for a hard swing
Flowers she would pick like guitar strings
For a real good whiff
Of how life behind par seems
Until then she a bar-teend
And pour hot lead shots out of carbines
If an inmate ever even think about departing
Before it's time for the theft of a hard thing
Wanna see what a bum riding BART dreams
Before he get gunned down, cause some sharp scene
Saw it all on the way to the art scene
Around the time they kicked us out, they had the park cleaned
She ain't living in a car she just RV-ing
Life on ice like the San Jose Shark team
Hard times, tryna duck em like Darkwing
Known for burning clothes and petty car-keying
And other less harmful skylarking
Bought a bag out of American Rag
A small Chinese-made American flag
Took a dollar bill then split it in half
The picture that she bought wouldn't fit in the cab
On the train trying her best not to live in the past
A bum probably asked could he spit in her ass
And that was it, fits, tantrums random
Helter-Skelter, a world gone Manson",Lupe Fiasco|||Life Death and Love From San Francisco|||158,0,

Dinner is ceviche out of seashells
Annoyed cause her date really can't speak well
But she forced to press on like Lee Nails
Next table was abhorred by the weed smell
She was done at the moment that the tee fell
A thick wool jacket on a cool night
Unimpressed by poems or the moonlight
Doesn't satisfy her like a game of pool might
Thinking ""what if Fantasia had a broom strike?""
Tuned right out of that school life
Soon as reality became a camera crew and a boom mic
So what do you do like?
She said ""Absurd last words from a dude off a Zoosk site""
And then left him
Like the Roots left Geffen
And the state Howlin' Wolf left Chess in
Stop to watch flows have an unpaid session on the steps of a Westin
She really need to check in
And to apologize to her best friend
New bras to put her chest in
Love life and death in...

When your spirit is strained
And you limited to change
The lyrics in your limericks'll change
A different hook, the way the sentences arranged
More demented in your deliverance, more sinister in your slang
Sounds more belligerent when it's sang
The truth is limitless in its range
If you drop a 'T' and look at it in reverse it can hurt
Look at the grimaces of the pain
And it's worse when it works and your membership is gained
But you forgetting the proof diminishes in the flames
Like 'poof', the media pours images in your brain
Of the score of the war where militants is slain
The faces of the guilty where innocence is proclaimed
And they filthy, the deaf ears are the winners
The listeners are the lames
Of the ballad of the man that the son of a minister has became

With the propaganda, and images of the gangs
A lost art, no apprentices in it trained
And they brainwashed, no interest in its stain

Ass is a daughter without a dad
Back is like Afghanistan, Iraq

Environment feet; justice get her so wet
Brains get you brains, you can fuck her if you protest

My mind is Pro Tools my head is a stool
Whats recorded in my dome gets reported when I zone
My mouth is a speaker I'm anchoring the misery
There's no friends the enemy of my enemy is my enemy
Beakers and test tubes full of memories
In my laboratory I create stories
Doze off then wake up surrounded by Forties
Wit Glocks tucked in they labels
And they caps is baseball hats
Playin poker at a table
Cigarettes massage they shoulders in belly tops showin off they navels
A dime sack side bets, a tech is runnin' for president
Jesus pieces walk around with niggas hangin' from they necks

Been ethnic cleansed by Jersey's tryna take over the set
And Television is on deathrow for killing BET and MTV over a dice game
And paralyizing CNN by knifing him in the neck
I hear Clear Channel's been fightin' him in the rec
Who's in for givin' grape Kool-Aid laced with strychnine to mixtapes and arm robbin' cassettes
Dope told me Weed was a crack fiend but Crack told me that Dope was a base head
Hi-hats told police he was just a soldier he did what the Bass said
The Snare and the Kick didn't make it out alive
The Sample made it out with some money but he died in the ride
The 808 got caught wit some work (He ain't never comin' home)
So the MPC's and the MP3's is fightin over his turf
Sean Don just gave birth
But she's thinkin' bout leavin it on the doorstep of a church
Cristal can't have kids she plottin' to kidnap it that she orchestrated with a purse
But Gucci told Fendi and Fendi turned and around and told Henny
And Henny is Moets baby's father
But she tried it anyway disguised as a nurse
In the newspapers it says ""Hip-Hop called Rock n Roll racist""
The Six ripped the Five and the Maybach taped it
A Hundred dollar bill just signed a record deal
But he blew all his money on the Braceletes
And givin' the Gold Dollar a face lift
A Button Up just drove by in a 6-4 Impalla
All the Rolex's is hatin' you see the smirks on they faces
The Havatampas is defending the Dutchess they keep catchin cases
But the judge is a Swisha he just give em iBonds and community service with the Papers
So the Newport's is gettin mad at the ZigZags then out come the razors
See the Kool's is killers on the creep
Rush up on the Philly, leave his guts spillin on the street
Some Gold Grills burned down the building of some teeth
Some Sharpened Tooth Brushes is holding the trampoline cuz some children finna to leap
I just seen Rocawear rock Sean John to sleep with the same heat that Baby Phat carried

Dumb things even bar common sense
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes a terpin intertwines with the turbans
Vines with turbans and removes the minds of serpents
Detergents, deterrents and permits, to build a hut

Great like Gildersleeve
As a king breathes through a silver sieve
Jack and Jill ain't up that hill enough
Filtering lean through a gold grill
Theorize things from swole hills
They came became what that po' kills
Throw ho drills on that hotel, that'll oil spill
Looking at space from a submarine
Putting that bass in the club machine
Pushing that cake till it mush in that face ain't no love between
Fancy ass man wearing glove and rings
Flying round town in a tub of wings
Found out how to make love to fiends

Too many best-rappers, not enough best-rhymes, though
Guess I'm delusional, used to doing it all the time, so
Maybe I'm just jaded, out of touch and unrelated
Unable to connect greatness based on the person who makes it
Or maybe I just hate it
And that would make me hater
Maybe it is great but that don't mean it's greater
Having your profile raised doesn't make you a raiser
Being ambiguous with assertions, isn't making you safer
What you mean, though?
Line us up, paddling us on the back
Like we steamboat, you president of the frat
You goin' sling toast, like you Ringo
And you think Doc Holliday's
Just goin' tolerate and too sick to let that thing go
It's just a matter of returns
Ashes to ashes, scattered them from the urns
To start a fire shaky to gather them from the burned
And reassemble these ashes, the blackness is something firm
Then moving blackness backwards in the bread of some other shit
Any deep we spreadin' wheat seeds from a bucket shit
McDonald had a farm and he lovin' it
Rolls Royce of the scented voice against the arms of the government
Artists gettin' robbed for their publishing
By dirty Jewish execs that think his alms from the covenant

Drill music, pop that pill music, kill music
Desecrating the temples in the ghetto
Funeral processionals increase their frequency
Because we can't break the spell of Geppetto
No one knows
And scrolls of obituaries contain more words than dictionaries
That will define how lions in Zion became alley cats
Who traded their baseball bats for gats that spat
Blood of the people across steeples
And concrete jungles that turn playgrounds into graveyards
That buriÐµd generations of Black and Brown men who lÐµft their post
Because they were misguided by ghosts in the land of the living
Ready, aim, fire
Wanna be the block, but can't buy the block, bulldozin' the block
Makin' the Red Sea choke on bones of drones
Sent by PPP loans to see how you spent the money
Left, left, right, left
To figure it out while the ancestors watch and aid those who call out to them
Through altars, pay phones, saxophones, bottles of liquor, glasses of water
The sum of a son and a daughter equals new life, the holy trinity
He was a baby boy, but he was kin to me
Born to Basimah in hands of the lion who said
""Store your water in the basement, because one day, it will be scarce and polluted""
He said, ""One day, grocery stores will be baren
Learn how to grow your own food and don't get caught starin'
Down the barrel of a gun
Learn how to run underground drills in Zion""
To be reborn lest you be scorned by the ways of the wicked
Who pillage our communities and natural resources for profit
He said, ""My children, each of you are prophets""
Don't let money be the sum of your deeds
Pull the weeds from your mind
Look to the front, the side, and behind
You each have blades that will drill a new earth
Manifest the new world that Columbus thought he found
Band together to reverse the weather to unite the seeds of the oppressed
Stand together and work righteously to be blessed
For generations to come
Drill down, Zion is in you",Lupe Fiasco|||THE LION?™S DEEN|||183,0,

I gave you honesty on my first joint
And y'all all came out
I showed you what change 'bout
Unroll your blunts, pour your champagne out
Dullers of the pain, so you can plainly see
The black man pain I campaign 'bout
God willing 'fore I wane, I take a champion route
Before I throw a bout: I'll walk out the game
While my fans in the stands is chanting my name out, Lupe
Uh, and it's going to be PPV, won't be back for free
Gone need scratch to see me rematch with me
My greatest enemy, is my inner me
So I take this urge and give you Revenge of the Nerd: Fahrenheit 1-15, uh
Yeah, and you know I fight the feeling
Box so I can shop, sometime it doesn't register
So I return to the ring, like Return of the King
With the habit of a hobbit it makes it hard to drop it
I'm a klepto stealing
And it gets the best

In the service of the perfect understand, uh, yeah

From the rear to the engineer
From the L to the Underground Railroad
From the redline to the TGV

Just makes me sicker, influenza, yeah
I'll abide by the censorship
Soon as they ride I'll get back on my nigga shit
Can't reverse
The boy-game Advanced, complete the genesis
I've broke bread with societies menaces
I've dedicated sentences to the dead, and said hold your heads to my niggas doin??sentences
I send condolences to the victims but, threats to the witnesses
On my path I was facing a paragraph, myself
So they sentiments is felt
When you hate your own and discriminate of self
In a cell gotta make your home, coz you might never make it home
Suicide on your side might commit it with your belt
Keep your pants on homie
Streets are damn so lonely, like only
A bunch of niggas won?™t help, nah
That?™s the enemy of stealth
Plus if they get caught how you gonna keep your heart fatigue
The hustler?™s diet is the enemy of health, give you heart disease
Arteries hard but its hard to leave the bread alone
Aren?™t we hard headed, headed for harm, but don?™t fret it homes
From the twist tied to the butt
We be rippin??it up
From the horror to the cure, don?™t force the issue
To you my niggas in the war, may the force be with you",Lupe Fiasco|||Jedi Mind Tricks|||194,0,
