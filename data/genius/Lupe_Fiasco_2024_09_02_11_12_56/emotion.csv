<Lyric> 
We're all chemicals, vitamins, and minerals
And vicodin with inner tubes wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'?
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling
That's buried living
And cherry-picking every lemon from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother Hurl
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips?
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks?
And smells like shotguns and deer piss?
They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
From Popular Mechanics to overdosing heart/hard
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the wordplay ain't playing that the man's states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weathermen
Or maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not “rain” like “Rain Man” or rain like “rain dance”
Or rain like a “slight chance of rain” when it's rainin’
Or “rein” like deer slaves to Santa Claus; sleigh man
But “reign” like queens that reign over made man
And not “Queen” like “Queen Killer; Rhapsody Bohem’” Queen
But “queen” like white-glove-wave-hand
And not “wave hand,” like it's a heat
Wave, so you make a fan by waving your hand
I'm talking “wave,” like you saying, ""Hey, man!""
And not hay for horses or ""hoarsest"" like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting that I was poor, but now I'm more than
It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops
Deep plots, in floor to ceiling windows for my pee pots
A little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop
And fan out like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise when the beat drop, and the sun dies when the beat stops...
Then it unties, then it relocks, then it relapse, then it detox
Then heat back like a heat pack on his knee caps of the weak spot
'Cause he want what we got, like yeah",Lupe Fiasco|||Mural|||0,0,confusion,curiosity,approval,"[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5923378467559814}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.21317000687122345}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.16796715557575226}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.052178431302309036}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.019058600068092346}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.013681843876838684}]"
Lupe Fiasco|||Mural|||0|||1,Lupe Fiasco,Mural,"Then forge poetry, like a young ornery Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots, who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching nor sorbet-y
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer of sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
Or more torturing, a water-boarding Barbie doll
A river of women like Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of Barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's
Homie, if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets, down at Mardi Gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My rap position was black condition and activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they not apt to listen, unless it's dropping on Activision
Are we apps, or are we bodies filled with apparitions?
Operating applications, stuck inside of Apple prison
Chicken hackin’ download updates that lack religion
Or are we more...
...Than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing, and foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings
Uhhh! Ain't nothin' to it, but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that, unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary, to a clitoris
The water bearer, heir of traditions, that I swear to never change
My chair position or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves out the mothafuckin' forest
As I perform a nerd storm, I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures, like Kool-Aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration
So that's OJ da Juiceman, meets OJ with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug, to judge who was, who drew blood
And, Lupe look at all these toucans, in a cemetery full of tomahawks
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colony, flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs, on the desert floor
Levitating youths, who know the truth of where the fountain hides
Buckaroo roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
A thousand parts, a pound of heart, an ounce of eyes
Announcing now, the doubt in mouth, pronounces out a count of lies
Chocula Counts by the count of five
Refrigerator roof, full of animals and monsters
Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat Konami sign contract
Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago, spray gun aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions isn't Chicano
Who’s the Boss? If it isn't Alyssa Milano
Dudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives
Sub-zero, Gaiden, hiding, Raiden in the pack as well
Sound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
Dodging Rain and catching hail
Faith seers need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Filet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
Yeah, I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness
Real Steel til' he realize his realness
Defeat Samsara, achieves nirvana and brilliance
Yeah!

They're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored
A complicated combination, maybe with no relevance

To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions

Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp
Sho' enough, in this little world

And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea, he don't wanna fuck her
He think she's bad at being a bitch like his mother
Momma never dressed like that
Come out the house, hot mess like that
Ass, titties, dressed like that, all out to impress like that

Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me

The rings are not sounds, but circles, wear these on your virtues
See through these circles just like Steve Urkel, 'til it's all universal

And it's dynamic in the high standard

Override lies and the laws of nations
Pilgrims bear witness at all the stations
Sun positions overcome traditions
Numbers govern our young religions
Dead levels making plumb decisions
Perpendicular to the undivision
That's bad curricular to the unconditioned
Any love less than unconditional is so
Under-Christian, it's unrepentant
The physical part of my church
Emits the invisible arts of my work
To make gold from garbage
Is not the alchemical point of this math
But truth be told it's the pursuit of gold
That turns the goal of men into trash
The soul's gold and they turning gold into cash
And your reflection is your connection
To more collections of more directions and paths
If your reflection is a mask, then you're reflective of mass
To see yourself just look at me then split your reflection in half

She would make me cool, and we would both rule, forever
And I would never feel pain
And never be without pleasure, ever again
And if the rain stops, and everything's dry
She would cry just so I can drink the tears from her eyes
She'd teach me how to fly, even cushion my fall
If my engines ever stall and I plummet from the sky
But she will keep me high, and if I ever die

Now I can't pledge allegiance to your flag
'Cause I can't find no reconciliation with your past
When there was nothing equal for my people in your math
You forced us in the ghetto, and then, you took our dads
The belly of the beast, these streets are demons' abs
I'm telling you that setup in them sit-ups is so sad
The system is a slab, corruption is the swinger
Sitting high, riding dirty, drag racing into danger
And it's so clean, pine trees smelling good
With work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood
So I can't shed blood on any battlefield of yours
I pray the ugly truth comes and shatters your decor
And as it all falls down in tatters on the floor
I shed tears, I don't know what really matters anymore

Dis nigga, like he's so exclusive
Sometimes dreams, peace of paper I got reams
Where the D go?, Put that on a rose now you
Pronounce it hero, you see?
Lu see like La Brea & Pico, with binoculars on my peephole
I feel my best work was album zero
Now with Deniro its boo boo in my backyard and
Ben burnt down my gazebo that dinero's a casino
Wit spit in the sandwich of the police though
They ain't see the steel plate up under my seat though
Still play it like Shaquille but I can free throw
I ain't playing but I compete, I ain't a player but I'm complete
And that's the win win a mason mind can't sign if the pen's Templar
Night vision on white linen is still green
Peace of Paper I got reams, make it rain
To make em smile, now rake it into piles
And go buy ya self some style, prom night/cat walk
Prepared the suit for weeks, or effortless as a Parisian
Walking down the street, I ain't in it
I'm just walking round some beats
Tongue in cheek, just talking round some teeth
Neighborhood watching
Made of good options, mastermind times
Neighborhood hoodie take the hood shopping
Back track to the stolen plates
What's a closed wallet to an open safe
Say your grace
Peace of Paper/Cup of Jayzus what we writing?
These ain't entendres these are secret indictments
Litte secret excitements
For willing minds I'm feeling fine
Balling hard and killing rhymes
Knocking off bigs and stealing shines
Hey shawty is it a crime?
To DMV everytime until I give em license
They waiting on lines
Peace of Paper I'm Kerry James
Commissions fly as the Constitution as a plane
Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS what we doing?
Pizza Lasers/ Cup of Razors
What you choosing?
Choosy mothers choose the smoothest peanut butters
And more cognizant fathers do George Washington Carver
A break from the paper it means do you identify more
With what's being made or the maker?
I'm what's being chased
I'm not the chaser
Cup of JAYZUS Peace of Paper
Check it, now paper make a plane & paper make it rain
But how fly is paper plane in the rain?
I'm fly paper on the brain
This and two-ply paper just ain't the same
I do do it for the bottom
In the air is where I stop em
I threw words like 2 birds, that's Batman and Robin
To answer all your hunches that's just how I throw my punches
We must somehow become a family that's why I throw 'em in bunches
Mushroom clouds or on the flo' with the fungus
If you look em up and down
From the foot to where he put his crown
The slow Pan to understand is Shaq on the shoulders of Yao
Over and over for miles
Peace of Paper, Cup of JAYZUS made a movie
Thank God on Friday, then buy a ruby on Tuesday
A couple beats from Jay, a couple beats from Ye
& make Food for thought, that's a restaurant in a day!
It would behoove thee
The critics say that I fell off I acknowledge I slipped
But what do you call falling from space into a bottomless pit?
And not pit like how Lui Kang can knock Baraka off with a hit
Knock it off for a bit
What would be really funny if I blew up after Drizzy
And started from the bottomless back to the topless like a watcher of Strips
Peace of Paper, Cup of JAYZUS
Peace of Paper, Cup of JAYZUS, bout it, bout it
Don't let ya inner fears result in a outer coward
From baby showers to 80 flowers upon my coffin roof
The upper class glass is not filled up with the coughing proof
Be more P and step ya Yessirs Up
P-O-P! Jayzus a cup of Courage, I can't can't
Thats double negative it's 2 earls
They really nice but they'll never touch the cup its like I gave it to two girls
This my odd future out in front Supreme shop
Fly as Rick Ross at a Wing Stop
Thought Kick Push was about drugs
It's not but just to be super sure
But from your perspective it might seem
Like Supreme out in front of Odd Future Store
So that skaters and skiers
Nose grinders and grinding up
Nose powders with ether
Not an Earl diss either but he might think it be and be like
""Lu's new should be Mr.Pure 2positive Shakur and 2 be sure he's
Not that really nice, That 2 girls and cup line sucked
It really means he gave himself a cup twice""
You just witnessed a double, a probable Odd Future diss in the future
And me ghostwriting my own rebuttals
You can't do that with a single cup
You gone need a couple, again you got a double
Got my shot on the rocks, but don't stop, keep pouring til it's a puddle
Peace of Paper, Peace of Paper Cup of JAYZUS what's the drive?
Greatest Rapper Alive or Greatest Rapper That Died?
Then on judgement day they say the greatest rapper's revived
Oh look who's here the greatest rapper's arrived!!
At the birthday party the greatest rapper surprised!!!
Bumped into Doom the greatest rappers collide
Everybody dead but AZ the greatest rapper survived
I'm not the greatest rapper... the greatest rappers' a lie
Got the same points as Lux the greatest rappers a tie
Told Jean, Foxy, & Rah the greatest rapper's a girl
They said the greatest rapper's a guy
Phone rang it was Ghost he said ""Kiss the greatest rapper... Goodbye!""
Chris said Common, Common said Kweli, Talib said I'm sure it's Mos Definitely!!

Smack might have the greatest but now I'm just playing favorites
Playing flavored to be reminiscent of Miles on smack playing faded
Peace of.... these niggas is nice

Shins like listen to them, ankles like shins making sense
Feet like why you running behind these niggas
They still trying to step inside ya prints
Bear trap rap don't step inside the clinch
Where da at? Don't jeopardize a better stride for limps
I exercise at length so electrify the fence
Let me inside the danger room on level 5 with the weaponized defense
With an extra side of the next guy's petty exercise attempts
The ghost of my career, better than most of what they revere
I take my targets and throw them back on my spear
I'm outta here

Like bad double dutch, and two Amsterdam's ain't enough—D.R.U.G.S. 
""Don't ruin us,"" God said—DROGAS—too much pride we electric slide
We should be closer, like soca, not a chain, but a choker

High as the angel on Dikembe's shoulder, eyes looking like MKUltra
Redacted vision through these dark shades, bad dreams through the screens of an arcade
Hangin' on the joy like the residues of heartbreak, park full of art, arteries full of parkay
Beating it, like new games, easily defeating
Or two gangs meeting for the evening, or two feet on a Riesling (Yeah!) slow wind

And somebody else to come and try and drug her

Cherubs and cerebellum
Terror at Sarah's wedding, Sam marrying Sam
Band pushed upon the finger of Sam's hairiest hand (OOOH!)

If it doesn't, well then you're wicked
Such is life, odd as Egg McMuffins at night
No answers, so let us watch these dancers
Structure reformed gracefully being born
On the pallet of dark grays, concaves and spirals
Kaleidoscope into a Eiffel
It ripples then it tidals, vacillates then it virals
Babylons then it Bibles and others

Power, power, 'til ain't no devils anymore

Move a thousand miles per hour down the street of my slum
And who do I meet, to the beat of my drum?
It was little Susie Uzi, she sold crack and was a killer
All-bitch dope tip, wasn't trappin' with no niggas
Had a long money minor, do that action for them figures
Her influence fully automatic, crackin' off the Richter, yeah!
Walked up to my ride, asked me ""Could she get inside?""
She pointed at her pistol so I properly replied
Told me, out here in the streets, she ain't have no competition
And with me up on them beats
Then we shared the same description
With a blunt between her lips, she said
""Now here's my proposition:
You just write a bunch of raps for me and I'ma go and spit 'em
Then we take 'em to the radio, the DJ better spin 'em
Then we take 'em to the record store

The dro grows from my footsteps
I'm the one that they follow, I am the one that they march with

The Oval offices, crack houses, and apartments
Through the mazes of the queens
The pages of the sages and the chambers of the kings

Speak every single language on the planet, ya'n mean?

Behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had

Then maybe you can grow up and be a stripper
A welfare-receiving prostitute and gold digger
You can watch on TV how they should properly depict you
The rivers shall flow with liquor, quench your thirst on my elixirs

And from a throne of their bones I rule
These fools are my fuel, so I make them cool

Sicker than when you use your dog to do assaults

Truth might still be alive like true and false
That's why I never really trust unless it's Lu endorsed
Sponsored by me and of course you know who enforced

Quiet as a kitten
Reply as silent as a Raphael-given instrument for stickin'
Or maybe riot as a lion
Would he tie in tiger for attention?
Tiggers and Poohs, niggas and jews
Mr. Opulent Christopher Robinson too
Reversal like
When that predetermined term expires on a turtle's knife
What of Korea, are you scared?
Or is something not there, like a Welsh rabbit full of hares
Animal farms and imaginary bears
The body is a house like a kangaroo pouch
Or an oyster-hoisted cow over crescent moons as it looms low in the night sky
Platoons of coons stand ready for the drive-by
Steady as the medley booms from the Akai
Affirm as in ""Aye aye""
Like it the second
Like a junior, like a third, like a eye
Like a observe from the view of a bird as it fly high
Sitting heavy like spaghetti in the belly of a wise guy
Who let these G's out the PI_STY?
Seems they taking cues from The Wire
Okay decorum, and keeping you from wanting to buy it
But you still buy it like you never left its sight
And like a slow gunfighter gun: unfired
Cow dung walls, hermit crabs in the mall, sting ray from the stars and barnyard laws

Dreads in the sky, I and I, 2 new Vans on a land four
Take that back, make that 2 new shoes on the van floor
Me and my band out on that road
On a never-back-down-from-my-stance tour
Yeah, touch more souls than a dance floor
While they touch less floors than a hand or
Ceiling fan or - wait, let me tell ya slower
Lift my fans up to the ceiling and you'll never touch the floor
Woah, now if Noah need a rower
I'll be there with my oar till we get back to the shore
Dad made me a soldier, GI Joe to these Cobras
Tryna FBI my Panther, CIA my Sankofa
Infiltrate my Carter, illuminate my culture
While they watching through that buckle, but I stay up on my hustle
Turn that belt back on they self, now I watch them scream for help
Like Africa need aid, or black women as maids
Uncover undercovers turn those maids to Bubba's mothers
Take the hero out the Nino, keep it real as trouble-trouble, huh?
Or maybe cartoon Martin on The Boondocks
Flip the script on chicks who think their shit smells like perfume shops
Help them girls find beauty without a magazine or movie
She Delilah with them .45s or Keisha with that Uzi
Now I know that's contradiction, wants and needs in competition
But it's hard to stay on point with such extremes in opposition
While we waiting on that compromise, proceed with that conscious eye
New gang alert: hashtag occupies
Repper 'til the death of me, FnF, what's left of me
All my hate is for the fake recipes for wrestling
Only time I wrestle's when I'm wrestling with settling
Only way I settle if we wrestle over everything
I know that that don't mix like ecstasy and ketamine
Funny how I'm only sick if you never catch a thing
Argue with your friends over what really the record means
Back and forth about its course, with professors refereeing
Why he so rebellious? Up-front with his realness?
They wanna be fiascoes, reproduce his failures
Emperor is his alias, but not Marcus Aurelius
This is more like Sparta: kick you down a well, kid
And on my last check, I copped the NSX, just like Pharrell did
Well did, better doings to come
My only promise is I'll never ruin the young
I'll never human the sung lyrics in a spirit that's
Superhuman to some, keep you pursuing the sum of
Slums, plus, get up out of them, plus, never forget
Just where you from, plus, make sure that you're ballin'
When you come back up in them, plus, we don't die, multiply
Every single come-up,  parum-pa-pum-pum, yup

As transactions from the end of 15th century to the mid 20th century
Their metal content varied from copper to brass
Most Manilla were manufactured in England or France
And like trade beads, were used for trades with Africa
The local chiefs on the slave coast of West Africa traded their human cargo
For many different commodities and the Manilla was one of them
This Manilla was manufactured in Birmingham between 1830 and 1850
Was being shipped to Africa to be bartered for one slave, each Manilla
These slaves were then packed into hulls of ships
And taken to the West Indies and the Americas
To be sold for vast profits if they did not die from the journey
The Duoro was one of the slave ships
With trade goods on her way to Africa to pick up her human cargo

<Lyric> 
Holy assumption of man into the heaven's sphere
Many mansions fit champions within its seven tiers
Evangelists re-imagine every 11 years
Pause for applause, evolves to what was never here
Born to death, born to die
Form the flesh, form the eyes
A veritable storm of winged forms swarms the skies
Marital norms unperformed but the porn survives
In the dorms of the scorn, they keep warm supplies
Gone to lose the use of tooth, horn and thigh
Before I was standing, I was landing
Two one-hand, one-man bands jamming in tandem
He who power naps, then plans gathering ransoms
And maps man's laps in a hand lathered in absinthe
Got a talent trafficking ramblings
And handing out amazing handmade maps of the labyrinth
Out the back of the wagon, out the back of the madam
Out the back of the Magnum, then out the trap of enchantment
Bellerophon with a megaphone, Mega Man
Desert zone, run marathons with sweaters on (sweaters on)
That was so simple but hot
In a place where it's so simple but not
Closed temples and old little forgots
And rode whole chisels, cripples who won't miss a salat
The old hoes that they won't give you a shot
But you can get the whole  pistol, it's gon' hit you a lot
These are real words from a savage mind
Unmaximized man on an average climb
Who don't deserve the whole truth and only half your time
Fit the life of a whole booth in only half a line
In the future life, I don't even have to rhyme
We'll get the entire Armageddon with only half the signs
Just yields and rail roads
In lush fields with bell tolls
Couple huddles of the unskilled but well told
It's unreal how off one deal to sell souls
And he got 'em by the dozen
Medulla oblongata is what got them by the oven
Like how the moonshine is what got him by the cousin
He got her by the bottom and he 'bout to stick his tongue in
Such an unsettling scene
An obscene setting for the unwedding of rings
The sharpest dresser at the unheading of queens
The architecture is something you've never seen
Dream clean, that's three words at the same time
And killed three birds with the same--
And won each and every hand with the same bluff and
Answers each and every man with the same question
What is it? But you still wanna know but I already done did it
I ball heavy, the physics
It's all, but it's already specific
If we doing what's already done, that means it's already terrific
That's rather meta-poetic, and just to acknowledge that
As an extra exhibit to what's already within it
The galleries lack the wall space
So I made a gallery of galleries, made of all space
If it was more small, it would be Moore's Law
From the land of the po' where we war, saw
From the hand of a pro to a whore jaw
Make her stand at the store 'til the snow thaw
Went from paper boy to editor
From throwing Ars Poetica with the arms of Federer
On the porches and steps to the farm houses of settlers
One of several sects who can come and charm the predators
We who measure the measuring tools of measurers
We who pleasure the pleasure tubes of pleasurers
We who lecture at treasured schools of lecturers
We who question the treasured rules of leveragers
Born to death, born to die
Mourn correct: immortalize
In a war, where your performance score is your salary
It's like fantasies combating your mortality
I'm just trying to restore sanity
Sigmund Freud boy, Leroy to your Vanity
To instill what kills krill destroys manatee
So heels spill but still seal deals that build factories
What looks Roman senator inner reveals Maccabees
Never just trust off guts, but what's actually
Unless it's Kuato's
Now, we back to pillars of salt, I recall back peeling potatoes
In hindsight, maybe attack of killer tomatoes
A seasoned shoulder's carrying plenty Pentium payloads
Now, that's another strata but I was making sense
Then cop out, took the highway and I was making chips
A nappy-head Karate Kid, I was breaking bricks
Can fight like Tekken 5, even taking 6
This rehabilitation, I be taking trips
""Don't Ruin Us"" God said, I won't make a dent
Hardly, but I'm still Harvey, I hope this making sense
Devil tooting his own horn, don't come and take a sniff
In the streets you gotta fight, you get punished for taking whiffs
To make that change for your team, you gotta have New Jersey Drive and a stomach for taking whips
I'm just trying to redeem
With these hands full of bars, don't beat me for coming clean
To unify the hooks, if you know it, then come and sing
Don't bust in while I'm asleep, nightmares who come in dreams
Samurais rarely die from another sword
This is 1985 meets the hover board
That was Bobby Johnson potato, just to underscore
Think deep, but don't let it fry your motherboards

He was everywhere, nowhere and down here

Awkwardly across the kitchen floor to your best

Were in your father's lap on November 23rd
And they were, ""Live for me"", and he did for you
Flipped to Neutron and stayed inside the crib for you

Imparted a deep sense of value you forever harbor

And the bond grow deeper between a mother and a daughter

Hello Gorgeous
This phone call's probably being recorded
Just know that I did it for the four of us
And those motherfuckers kept ignorin' us
After this I'm going underground
If they come asking give them the run-around
How does Costa Rica in the summer sound?
Couple days then we moving to another town
Yea I know them dreams, seams
Just know that time'll never come between
Space either, fake features
Things that we reject but connects all us believers
The insurrection's gone viral
They'll never stop it now, I hope it all spirals
Outta control, like a dam with a hole
From here on out it's all about survival
The way we left things they probably think we rivals
But don't be naive, they hate you more than I do
Remember always speak in opposites
I hate you so much, it's such a compliment
I know that defies the common sense

Of them fighting our water with fire
He said that we need something drier
To really impress the empire
Funny cause he really hated war
But why we went to war is what he really hated more
Said it's silly how that our schools make us stupid and our jobs make us poor
When he came back from the Corps
Is when he really got serious
Read a lot of books, started acting all mysterious
The VA is what really made him furious
Told him his condition didn't exist, period
That's why he started that petition
Went all the way to Washington, said they didn't listen
To a white male Christian
He just laughed when they took our father's pension
He said that you gotta act in opposites
Helps you hide your tracks when you stand up to the dominant
But I knew he felt bad
Told me later was the saddest day he ever had
To see our dad so hopeless
That was the turning point that's what really gave him focus

""If you had to paint the gutter, which color would you choose?""
Said the patron to the painter, the painter said, ""The blues""
""Do you act off intuition or languish and peruse?""
""More like tap into tradition from the angle of my mood""
He looked back at his canvas while strangling a tube
A master of the palette, all sanguine and cool
The music mostly jazz, the jazz mostly old
Punctured by some punk and some old smoky soul
An atlas on the trunk from the land of broken goals
Just a cover and a back that you open and you close
""Where are all the pages?"" The paintеr said, defanged
""I ripped 'еm all out and made some paper planes
Fish grease absorbers and some origami cranes”
Poured hisself a drink and then poured it down the drain

""Do you consider yourself wild or conforming to a style?""
The patron pointed at a pile, ""Are those rejections or mistakes?""
The painter said, ""That is not for question or debate
Most of what we know as art is the projection of a faith
The product of a Pontiff or the election of a saint
A gift from the read for the digestion of the can't
A visual garnish for the confessions of the frank
Displays of physical carnage make connections to the ranks
Goes over very well with South Americans and Yanks
Not to sound shamanistic, but there's medicine in paint
It gets kinetic if you let it, there's a fetish in its strength
Martyrdom will call, Russian roulette is in the flanks
And most would pull the trigger if the weapon's full of blanks
But when there's a pool of sharks and you step into the tank
That's the pool of art that got 'em headed to the plank
But they fell for the deceptiveness of the secularist's complaint
The upheaval of the cathedral into the edifice of bank
That pile over there is just the evidence of angst
The failed revival of a perfectionist when his efforts have just sank
A selection of the waste that lacks direction or a base
You lose all of the plots for the affections of a race
Man does not become superior 'cause you connect him to a cape
Nor does become inferior because you connect him to a ape
I never wanted my life to be a collection of some dates
And holiday my days away and intellectually sedate
It's not really a beef but conceptually it's steak
Like do genitals and gender roles successfully conflate?
The current art world is just competitively opaque
It never ceases to amaze, my mouth is medically agape
One day its raising up the brand, the next it's shredding it to flakes
And the velocity of trends is what referees the pace
Professionally accept what ethically I hate
So in all of my work, you see this wrestling with fate
Deceiving in the brushstrokes how aggressively I strafe
Less like putting on some makeup, more like severing a face""
""Wow,"" said the patron with a smile
""That's the most interesting diatribe I've heard in a while
How you articulated the nature and put it all on trial
Took it up to Heaven, then put it on the ground""
The painter asked the patron, ""Can you stand up on the pile?
I've had a flash of inspiration, my creativeness aroused""
The model took its place, the painter grabbed a lighter
Doused the shit in gasoline and set it all on fire",Lupe Fiasco|||MS.

Lord have Murcielagos waiting on the nigga
At the end when the time come
Get the drop on the weed spot
Like there's too much water in the tea pot, huh
Lord have Murcielagos on the poor, nigga, pour, nigga
They adore the event of war
Down force on the doors of adored niggas
Does the Lord like to thank award winners?
And the war winners'll rewards inner
Or the all-enders ain't the pure chemists
So the form in this can be raw in this like the porn business
Keen to king 'til the, 'til the pawn hit us
If he goes, half a million sold, sold the soul, going gold
In the end will it go to the pawn business?
You ain't doing nothing with it
Let a nigga get it for the low-low-low-low
Lames tried to form it, brains couldn't storm it like a Ororo-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro
In the Philippines eating chicken wings, smothered with adobo-dobo-dobo-do
Vatos, fiascos, vocos locos like a cho-lo-lo-lo
Gadget go, go, go, go, go, ratchet ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Santa ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, K-Ci, Jo-Jo-Jo-Jo-Jo
Brown skin brother in a fed box at the hell lil' nigga live there for months
Except these young, black males wouldn't drive if you give them trucks
Nigga, nigga, nigga what, I don't give a, give a, give a, fuck

Compose yourself, like a self-aware opera
Conjurer, in the zone like Sonic to
Produce me a sign of the end-times
In time to make profit off the T-shirts
And monetize all the research
And leave Earth feet-first
Breech, behold
Whites get whiter in the cold
And colors don't fade in the bleach, hah
Applause then fall through a man-made south
Talking to a doll at the pancake house
Then bring the lightsaber-ers
So bring the lampshades out, mood
To say something lewd on the news
And move like views on a cruise

This your beat I'm sorry, but her eyes were so starry
I just had to get some-uhh...one up it
Hit the bricks, drop the coins, pick up the shit
Like a pooper scooper even dog shit was once eukanuba
Underdogs of the past can be the shit up in the future
I brush my shoulders off to remove my bazooka
What we doing? Deck full of spades, hold a mic like Bob Barker
It's manure if you new to the ways of the lupester
The base meaning is I'm a roofer, (woo!), I'm going like fuschia
All I need is a coup and a princess behind me like King Koopa
If a nigga with me and he black he might shoot ya
And that's motherfuckin real, even my mother, is fucking, real
Kitchen counter tapping then undercover skills
Your beat is in my bedroom giving head to 'em
Stretch it out, stand up in it and call it leg room
Beat the beat till it's beat there's eggs to 'em
Then repeat, eat it till it sleep, then wake it up
But then don't speak to it cause now it's like the feds to 'em
Beats having trouble going to sleep cause now I'm like Fred to 'em
And if I can be any meaner, our patina was Martin and Gina
To her I would have ran, but now she like Pam
She still want the flow but now I'm like damn
Whisk her away, but I had to scram back to the bullshit
Scramble to ya pulpits and tell the preacher he legit
Beats get weaker the deeper that I get
Damn right she ain't even get the shaft, I'm just speaking from the tip
When the fire gone then I quit, cellphone still along on the trip
So I can speak to the choir from the throne on my ship
And noble or sober or my song nobler
Eating with our hands and the waiter is a fan
Shout out to Mike Ferro keeping paper in my hands
Tailored Savile Row, or Mastermind Japan
Sky dropped six on the blazer
Drop top Aston versus Cobra, I'mma race ya
Free Rico, before he do his bid
Got a father tatted on him, gone show him where it is
Black dragon slayer they ain't knowing what he did
Want everybody in Bull city eating like a pig, lets do it!

Welcome to my whirlwind, turn like Tilt-A-Whirls
I be throwing up my set, yes, hurlin' up the world and
Going out, we goin in', say ""hello"" to my girlfriend
Vomiting and conquering, that C-Class is a ""girl Benz""
My class is overseas, I be on ""all around the world"" rims
Women's international, my will is like my girl then
Goin' in is goin' wild, goin' in is goin' strong
Going for the gold, some world-class goin' in is goin' on
I can do this all day, I ain't got it all, 'kay
They all say I'm one wall short of a whole hallway
One Halls short to keep from coughing all in y'all face
Man, I'm so appalled, I can keep them all safe
I can really ball and put titties all in y'all face
That was Robert Paulson, and that deserves a pausin'
So that's Blart, Pierce, and all that's missing is a bearer
For the coffin that is needed for this beat when I'm done talkin'
Balling in the morning, this feel like my callin'
This the new bitches brew, fall off in my cauldron
Lupe's going crazy! Flow is going almonds
We going back to goin' in, you gonna need a Garmin
Then go and get a car to put your Garmin and my broad in
Destination everywhere, reputation everywhere
Music drop, music stop, one man take up every chair
I know that that ain't very fair how one man take up everywhere
But it ain't for long though, it'll be some closure
Or maybe I'll be everywhere after I'm all over
Say goodbye then start the show, fall on off then start to blow
Acting like I'm rapping, it's that Joaquin Phoenix Facebook flow
Flow is in the microwave, call it Michael Tyson flow
Killing is a dirty job: Michael Myers, Michael Rowe
Bring it back like Michael Fox, see how far them Michaels go
I feel like I'm Michael Crichton writin' with a microphone
I ain't saying you should die but you should leave your life alone
Maybe borrow one of mine, fast life, life at home
Life is like a box of chocolates, pockets full of Toblerones
Pocket full of wallets so what continent we shopping on?",Lupe Fiasco|||Joaquin Phoenix|||83,0,annoyance,approval,disapproval,"[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8158290982246399}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.04015206918120384}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.028245484456419945}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.025738846510648727}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.01251248549669981}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.007166068069636822}]"

I wish I could just kiss you on the cheek

We both wear glasses, the difference is
I was in school thinking it was cool, you was thinking of skipping classes
Listening to your track record, I could see you were skipping classics
I did it on my first one and delivered to the masses

From the podcast, I've been kind of skeptical
This ain't our first clash, this is just one of the several
I ain't trying to bash, but it was like you was off your schedule
You was throwing more than jabs, I was like, ""This nigga's incredible""
We had to fucking edit you
I don't know what vegan Detroit vegetable Dr. Sebi diet infected you
To think that we share the same metrics or somehow I was less than you
And I was the type of nigga that you could get really disrespectful to
I ain't never lectured you, I get energetic and joke
But in real talk, nigga, I ain't never disrespected you
I'ma punch you in your fucking face and we all think it's silly
I'm thinking like ""Won't this bitch nigga clean up his fucking city?""
I mean you got all of the clout, know how to bring all them niggas out
You can walk the walk, I mean, we seen you walk all over your house
But me and Mickey is geeks because you got some heat
Like I didn't go to the closet and put guns all over the couch
Your mental health hotline, I think that shit is grown up
But you're the very last nigga that should be picking that phone up
I spit your verse to get immersed inside my enemy
And to remind you they got to go through you just to get to me
Subtle subordination
Perpetual sidekick, nigga sort of a station that you used to
So you ain't got to get all extremely too personal on your albums
When you not surrounded by bigger artists to fucking boost you
Nigga, you called me, I didn't recruit you
But no regrets, I take it as a test
You said, ""Lupe, you gotta have some grace
Not be so haphazardly to put the truth all in they face""
Now that I think about it, that's kind of half-and-half
If a nigga asked you for the strap, why would you keep it in the stash?
If you ran the world, we'd get defeated in a flash
You really gonna be the boss, can't keep secrets from the staff
I learned that in the streets, nigga sweeping trash
Keeping my city clean while you was talking 'bout beating a nigga's ass
That shit is wack, long live backpack rap

Your penmanship has the fingerprints of a gimmick
And affection and the intimacy of impressions of that nigga you friends with

I can't even blame you, the nigga's one of my favorites
Fuck that, back to my status

Inwardly successful, and outwardly I've made it
Clearly, if I was a regular rapper, you wouldn't even come near me

What's Siri to Steve Jobs? A Budden to Tahiry?
I'm excessively cheery, promote my niggas' theories
What's an alien to a Pentagon report? I see your brother tryna cheerlead
That's what he's supposed to do
And everybody that's fucking close to you
'Posed to support, push you forth
And calm your black ass down 'cause they ain't put you in The Source

Confusion in abundance what I have
Good thing that God accept cash
Maybe buy my way up out His wrath

Look at all these friends that marketing makes
How many fries can these arteries take?
I'll give McDonald's a little help here
I think they should expand into healthcare

Uhh, I just need a minute to replenish who I am
And who I am is so dependent on exactly where we stand
I stand in any pose, anythin' but tippy-toes
Don't want you to feel smaller, always taller
Now I'm a cheerleader, she a baller
The difference in height isn't aight, I left my ego at the altar
Now every ring's a sting and everythin' I taught ya
Is comin' back around to me, just like revolvers
And every single click is just hammerin' it home
Who knew Russian Roulette involved answerin' the phone?
Until my signal dwindles or my channel is in roam
Or my cellphone dies or it's cancer in my dome
And dear nix the tone, as I pour my fuckin’ pain out
One of your short nodes, might blow my fuckin' brains out
But you ain't even pick up

Eating piano pies at the Vanguard

Food and liquor stores rest on every corner
From 45th and State to the last standing Henry Horner
J&J's, Harold's Chicken, good finger lickin'
While they sin, gin, sin sin at Rothschild's and Kenwood Liquors
The winos crooked stagger meets the high stride of the youth
Searchin' for the truth
They rebel and raise hell across alleyways and in classroom settings
They get, high off that trunk bass and 20/20 rims
They rock braids, Air Force Ones, and Timbs
They drink Hennessy, Hypnotiq, and 40's
They call they women hoes, bust downs, and shorties
They keep funeral homes in business and gunshot wards of hospitals full
Prisons packed, bubblin' over in brown sugar
They keep empty, Westside lots crowded, hype's powdered
The well is running dry
The days of Malcolm and Martin have ended
Our hope has descended and off to the side
Waiting for the reinstallment of the revolution
Because we are dying at the cost of our own pollution
But God has another solution, that has evolved from the hood
I present one who turns, the Fiasco to good",Lupe Fiasco|||Intro|||99,0,disappointment,sadness,realization,"[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8678143620491028}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.06612526625394821}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.05083317682147026}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.026156127452850342}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.02271793596446514}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.01543134544044733}]"

Hijabs, hoodies, afros, locks
Teddy bear, liquor bottle shrines, rocks
Tanks, prayer rugs, church pews, Mexican corn stands
Blood, sweat, and tears, police batons
Gas masks and bullets create graffiti on corners
Murals that salute freedom or death for liberty
Be it Englewood or Egypt, Bedstuy or Baghdad
Syria or Liberia, the west bank or the west side of Chicago
Where food and liquor stores still occupy the block
While police and community watchmen justify why they shot
Emmit Till and Malice Green, Rekia Boyd and Trayvon Martin
Better not wear that hoodie while shopping for a carton
Or whatever they sellin’ in your food desert
Cause your soul is dessert and will be dissected and consumed
On the Fox evening news while we sing the blues
The New Jim Crow caged bird sings
Cause he’s tired of occupying his misery and of our marching
He wanna fly to a higher consciousness
But his school on academic probation
They gave him medicine, diagnosed him with a felony and mental retardation
So he refuses to cease the firin’, nobody’s hirin’
In Illinois, 67 is the new age when you retirin’
Class lines have blurred, those who used to have, have not
Pensions bein’ snatched
Those who never have keep their hands stretched
Social services being cut
Sterilization clinics giving out pills to numb the womb
Young girls referring to their vaginas as tombs
Thinkin’ protests are temporary and trendy
Well rock a t-shirt and carry a poster
And two weeks later it’s back to normal
But they say times are changin’
The revolution is becoming second nature, causes are combining
People carrying torches, hope burning from their hands
Attaching explosive devices ‘cause they keep stealing their lands
In the name of freedom
Hijabs, hoodies, afros, locks
Teddy bear, liquor bottle shrines, rocks
Tanks, prayer rugs, church pews, Mexican corn stands
Blood, sweat, and tears, police batons
Gas masks and bullets create graffiti on corners",Lupe Fiasco|||Ayesha Says (Intro)|||101,0,annoyance,realization,approval,"[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.9401068091392517}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.029196254909038544}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.02081899531185627}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.01806546188890934}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.011398311704397202}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.008392151445150375}]"

Peace, no material possessions shall cloud my judgement
As I reach, in an ethereal direction to provide my substance
Love is not found but resides insides me, I manifest this
I will respect myself and wear serenity as my necklace
I will replace what I take and have tranquility as my breakfast
Shed a new light on a new path
I will gain rhythm and lose wrath, attain wisdom and refuse graft
And build upon what I built on and wisely regulate time I do have
Cause what is defeat? But just the evidence of my haste
Lack of preparedness, in my waste, so I wait
Surround myself with nutrition, wholesomeness and true livin'
Use natural codes of conduct to remove schism when the rules missin'
I will pursue felicity, find value in simplicity
Altruism and empathy will be the first thing extended to my enemy
Clarity will be the trademark of my friendships
Just invest in my business and appreciative of the rarity of my existence",Lupe Fiasco|||Tranquillo|||102,0,approval,optimism,curiosity,"[{'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.4321823716163635}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.28923818469047546}, {'label': 'optimism', 'score': 0.13465134799480438}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.09813094884157181}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.05226569622755051}, {'label': 'admiration', 'score': 0.0507916621863842}]"

Guava Casaba melons, getting a spot at competition
Titties and teeth, so silly of me, no really, it’s free
Aye you can use the phone like a new computer wand
That’s an Ethernet pun, cause dial-up’s all done
When it took twenty minutes just to download one
Aye, you got a fine face, also a dime in your behind
Please can I find some time space to find base
Kinds of rhymes to describe how you’re designed great
And maybe remove the mind freight
Like it’s overhead cranes at the train yard

Before the aliens came part

Like dial-up’s not a fan of the wi-fi

Driving a Volkswagen Beetle off into the California twilight
I usually got top cause I’m a guy right
But if you’re gay that’s straight too
Hey, I don’t hate, I got a couple of friends who went bi twice
Did that arrive right?
Do you like whole stories or just the highlights
Cause I like to write your life story on the sky
Made of Lite Brites, remember those?
Ten years old, let me guess your age
You were a ten, ten years ago
Am I right, who you calling?
Maybe New Orleans where your mother lives
With your brother's kids
Cause he locked up cause
Of what some other motherfucker did
Love to fib 'bout the Fibonacci sequence
Do you flicker like Liberace Sequins
Or maybe twinkle like little stars
And tingle like little scars
I run a wrinkle with you like a car hood
And crash test and beat-box while we re-run
Saul Williams doing the slam set
Then wrap like saran over the pan
Keep the yams fresh, sweet
Five different songs, over five different beats
And this one’s called Valley
I wrote it on the plane in the chair by the galley
On the way to Cali, chicken in the salad
Sounds like a ballad
You loyal, so I’m Khaled
Buy your momma a palace
Scratch that, buy your momma what matters

War gives value to life by showing it can be taken away
And in a perverted way, those who wage war delude themselves into thinking they create life
Or at least make it meaningful

Dogs on fire, the mosquitoes, flies and squirrels

And their shadows burning to the ground from the flash
And if they didn't pass what's the future, Hibakusha?

Haters pray to god that I turn slow
Like I'm sipping on purple
But I ain't on your glow
I'm in a whole 'nother circle
Trying to keep it clean like church clothes
Said that respect was something had to work for
But that ain't gonna work though
Get your respect, but lose all my worth, no
You can dead that, get a hearse, go
Don't need 48 you'll find a killer in the first floor
It was me boy, to commercials
Feeling out of place like PETA at a fur store
So I left with a couple dozen fur coats
Said I could never break away from your hold
Watch me, turn though
Said that I blew it like Turquoise

Know it hurts but I really don't care though

<Artist name> Lupe Fiasco <\Artist>
<Song title> DETAILED EXPLANATION OF LUPE FIASCO’S TETSUO & YOUTH <\Song title>
<Lyric> 
--- After listening to Lupe’s new album, Tetsuo & Youth, multiple times, I specifically want to begin this analysis by getting into the album’s last portion which ran from the season of Winter to Spring. Note that there is a lot of religious content that was referenced in this time period; I will get into all that later
--- The season started with “Chopper” and a lot of people are wondering why a song like ""Chopper"" is on the album. Well, you can't just get into a song like ""Deliver"" without giving an example of WHY the pizza man won't come to the ghetto. That is why “Chopper"" is there. It's a hood ass trap song with features from rappers that purposefully spit their verses from the perspective of the killers, drug dealers, and the gangstas that live in the trap
--- Moving onto “Deliver,” like I said, this song shows the results of what went down in “Chopper"" and the reasons behind not delivering pizza to the hood. If we look at the main line from the hook, ""Pizza man don’t come here no more,” it contains a triple entendre: firstly, the forefront meaning is that the pizza can’t be delivered to such dangerous locations; secondly, the PEACE-of man doesn’t come there no more, and this is similar to the first meaning because there is violence that is preventing the pizza man from delivering the pizza; this all goes back to “Chopper” and how the absence of peace stirs up the controversy; thirdly, the piece-of MAN doesn’t come there no more. This one ties into the next song, “Madonna (And other mothers of the hood),” because the piece-of MAN not being there is referring to the father figures that are absent while their child grows up without them. With no father figure, the child will live his life without an example to follow or know what is right from wrong, so there are significant chances that he’ll be sucked into the hood activities such as drug dealing and gang affiliations, which will eventually lead to the mother's concern for her child’s well being
--- With all the information thus far, I think it’s time to start pointing out some religious references. Firstly, Madonna in other words is another name for Virgin Mary, who was the mother of Jesus Christ who never had a blood related father. Similarly to how Mary feared Jesus’s prosecution, the last thing that the mothers of the hood want are to see their sons die before their very eyes, but at the end of the song, referencing to the movie Boyz In Da Hood, the child lied dead in his mom’s house just like Ricky in the movie, much like how Mary was in attendance at Jesus’s crucifixion
--- The next song, “The Adoration of the Magi,” contains a significant amount of video game references that foreshadow two things: The Game, and the next song which he appears in, “They.Resurrect.Over.New."" This song is speaking about a Magi, or a king from old times. In this song, the Magi is played by The Game. For those who are not familiar with The Game's background, he can be described as someone that controls everything in the evilest of ways, and this song is almost a continuation of the song he appeared in from The Cool, “Put You On Game,” which was rapped primarily from The Game's perspective with lyrics from that song that go, ""I’m sure somebody'll find you tied up in this bag behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had, then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper.” This song, “Adoration of the Magi” continues the baby theme in the chorus as it uses other artist’s albums that had babies on the covers (Ready to Die, Carter 3, NWTS, Illmatic, etc.) to symbolize that they they are too young to be on a rap cover, but that is why the Game adores them so much and is interested in the youth. That is why he made his reappearance to this album because the main theme of the whole album is about our youth and that is who he is interested in (Which Lupe has stated numerous times in his interviews if people were wondering. That’s where we get the title of the album with a little flair with Tetsuo in front of it). Towards the last line of this song, it becomes clear that the baby grew up to be a stripper just like The Game suggested and she is even having her own child too but doesn’t know it; this is why she is wanted by the game, or “adored by the magi.”
--- Religiously speaking, the Adoration of the Magi story has to do with the 3 western kings that lived centuries ago. They followed a star and found the whereabouts of Jesus where they presented him with gifts. This event happened on Jan. 6 which marks the same day Lupe released this song
--- Now that we have went over the 3 singles for this album (Madonna, Deliver, Adoration of the Magi), it’s about the time we can discuss a vital point that Lupe tweeted, he said, “What if I told you that Madonna Delivered the Adoration of the Magi?” Here’s were things get even crazier. From a religious perspective, ""Madonna (Virgin Mary) Delivered the Adoration of The Magi (Jesus)."" If we look at the phrase from a hood perspective, he is saying, “Madonna (and other mothers of the hood) Delivered the Adoration of The Game (strippers, gangstas, drug dealers, killers).”
--- Leading into the next song, They.Resurrect.Over.New. will probably have the listener wondering why there are so many video game references, well the answer is simple. If this album is about the Youth, then what other way would be better to portray The Game in front of the youth’s eyes? To a grown man, The Game is the drug game, strip clubs, war zones, etc., but to a baby, The Game is just simply a video game to them. In this song, Lupe said things like “we should be closer” and that is a direct message to the ghetto because his people are killing each other in there. Ab-Soul continues the Game theme by saying, “Trapped in a game where, the trap is The Game, yeah.” And the only way to get past The Game is to “Proceed to the next level” which is telling the youth to not fall into the hands of The Game and end up as the killers that make up Chi-raq, or the strippers that make up the strip clubs, or the drug dealers that make up the drug game. Rather the point of proceeding to the next level is to break away from the shackles, or like Ab-Soul’s last line, “Unloose the Noose.” That is the only way to crush the hood stereotypes
--- That is about it for the story, but there is still the concept of the seasons that go on throughout the album that seem really random. Lupe described them as palette cleaners to give the listener soothing breaks throughout the album, but it is even more. Notice how in winter, there are no kids on the streets and you get a chilly, eerie feeling from the sounds playing? That was the mood set for Chopper to symbolize that there are no kids on the street during that time. This is why Lupe wants his people to proceed to the next level so they can finally put an end to the violence that Choppers bring. That way the pizza man can Deliver to the hood again, the kids can play on The Streets again and ultimately, so The Game can be abolished. Why else would Lupe have a music video for Deliver where a kid has to go out of his way into a nice neighborhood to receive something that can't be brought to his parts? That is the lesson that Lupe is trying to teach. You can't just sit inside all day messing around with The 'Video' Game. You have to eventually get out so it won't end up controlling you, which is the true meaning of proceeding to the next level. In reference to pizza, you can't wait for things to be Delivered to you, sometimes you have to go out of your way to obtain them
--- Finally, we arrive at the last track of the album, Spring. This is an outro filled with cheers and fireworks that signify the end of a truly incredible album. If listened closely, the sounds of the kids can be heard once again meaning the violence has came to a halt. Obviously this is not the case in real life so could this be an alternate dimension where things are different? Furthermore, why are there no songs between Spring and Summer? When you go to repeat the album, it's like a whole chunk of it is missing. Did Lupe leave out a couple months on purpose? Maybe he is trying to say whatever takes place after Spring is for the youth to decide since they're the future. What they choose to do from there is up to them whether they want to stay in the ghetto forever or want to leave one day. It’s up them to decide what happens next. On a side note, Lupe didn't want this album to have a deluxe version, maybe for the reason that it would divert the listeners attention from the inner meaning. He may have truly intended for there to be no song between Spring and Summer so the Deluxe users wouldn't replay the album and get distracted by the bonus tracks
--- Like Lupe said in his interview with Sway, it may take years upon years for this album concept to be fully digested and respected for what it is. He said it may even take 100 years, and here is the reason why. If this album is about the Youth growing up and the ghetto's making peace one day, then the day that happens will also be the same day Tetsuo & Youth will be looked at as a masterpiece. This was the point of the video for Deliver. That video summed up the whole entire album. Lupe was trying to show that unless true peace is formed among the ghettos, then that is the picture they'll be left with forever. It's practically asking the question, if you can't respect yourselves, how can you expect others to respect you? And it's not only them, the youth has to pay for their elders mistakes and the unfairness of not getting a pizza will fall upon them as a child, then other factors will eventually come into play like they'll quit going to school and they'll remain in the hood selling dope for their whole life, so the point is, until their role models can spark the change, the cycle will never end
---In conclusion, this was a summary of the last 5-7 tracks of Tetsuo & Youth. If you read this far, I hope you have a better understanding of the album's concept and the season’s meaning and message.  #FNFUP #T&Y #DROGAS",Lupe Fiasco|||DETAILED EXPLANATION OF LUPE FIASCO’S TETSUO & YOUTH|||112,0,realization,approval,confusion,"[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8311904668807983}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.06117924302816391}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.0521840825676918}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.029331007972359657}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.017828861251473427}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.015276485122740269}]"

Uhh, I exist, spoken in a confident voice
Can world shift and continent hoist
Look under for the plunder
A rich man's song that gets sung for a sum out the lungs of a stunner
But life turns to a station and a hustler to a hummer
Went from speaking and now not even sinking
The game is karaoke ’til it tries to punish poke me
Kinda throw me words slowly, fade degrading in the foley
Waving metal sheets make thunder
Fooling I was younger; fool me when I'm older
Fool me now, screw me down to the sofa, taking Soma
Drinking soda, eating vulture, tweeting vulgar
Playing Madden getting fat and getting cultured with the quotes
In the hopes people will get the jokes
If it rains you will get the float

Lupe Fiasco|||Quotations from Chairman Fred|||120|||7,Lupe Fiasco,Quotations from Chairman Fred,"There was a man who wrote many things
But Carlyle said, um, that we could not be ruined
Because no lie could live forever
William Cullen Bryan said, ""Truth crushed to earth, would rise again""
And James Russell Lowell, made it more plain
That we would not be ruined or destroyed
Because he said that, ""Truth, forever on the scaffold, lies forever on the throne
But that scaffold sways the future, and behind the dim unknown
Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch, above his own""
These powerful scriptures were also used by the man
In whom we celebrate his birthday today, Dr. Martin Luther King
And Dr. King told us to practice non-violence and the power of love
Non-violence and the power of love has brought us thus far
The agape love that we have for ourselves
That we have for our people is the reason why our people
In this particular diaspora called, North America
Have not been totally ruined
We have not been totally destroyed, we have not been exterminated
So therefore, uh, my dear brother, um, Wasalu
We call you, we thank you for what you've asked me to do
And we shall continue to study to show ourselves approved under God
Workman that needn’t not be ashamed
Rightly this dividing the word of truth
And so at this time, in this city
Where young men's lives are not worth much
In this city where our people have been discriminated against
And kept from the resources which we
Rightly deserve as a majority of people in the city
We are dependent upon the most high creator of the ends of the world
That I call Elohim Jehova
And we are dependent upon him to keep us from falling
To keep us from being ruined, to keep us from being exterminated
And we thank the Almighty
For the privilege of being here with my niece
Is to impart these words
And I hope it would be of assistance in this project
God bless you and thank you

Album on hold, whole world on hold
The crowd is like, ""HO!"", operator's like, ""Hold"" (""Please hold"")
Man, now ain't that cold
I'm just tryin' to talk to my homie that's up in the hole
And homegirl not tryin' to be a ho, even though she on a pole
Can she get a second chance? No
Whoa, like the opposite of go
That ain't how it's supposed to be or butterfly
But for the sake of rhyming, let's just say butterfly-ee
The truth stings like Muhammad Ali
I tell 'em, tell 'em, don't homicide me
I'm just a little old hope with his back against the ropes
Fightin' for his fans and fightin' for his folks
But the boos from the crowd can become so loud
If I can block 'em out then, I could knock 'em out and
Dance around the ring but until then I'll sing",Lupe Fiasco|||Till I Get There|||126,0,disapproval,confusion,annoyance,"[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.7116940021514893}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.2616797089576721}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.05163279175758362}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.04829363524913788}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.025092927739024162}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.014422588981688023}]"

The empowerer of the kings that came with claims and disease
To leave where the native peoples were staying
Believe, my engagement ring received
And flossed at the cost of a bonded child miner's pain
Long ago kings used to wear 'em in their armor when they fought other armies
Because it used to scare 'em

Into the countryside just to get his shine on
I fear what De Beers and his peers used to do
Before the world really knew, just to get their mine on
Making paper with slave labor
And hitting little kids with life time bids making them cut and shine stones
Inflating the price and making them look nice
And I wasn't thinking twice when I was putting mine on
About a young shorty in Sierra Leone
Or other conflict countries that people call home
I figured I would never go to Angola
So it never did affect me there, maybe indirectly
That my neck leash was funding a rebellion or a military coup
Started by militias that don't believe in following none of Geneva's rules
I was brushing off the haters, trying to be cool
Didn't have a clue that the rapper was helping the rapers
Raiders of the villagers, pillagers of the schools
Shooters of the innocents, torturers of the witnesses
Burners of the businesses and my bracelet was the fuel
Uh, I ain't pushing an agenda, homie
I'm just pushing the facts, fuck Bush
'Cause there's people doing worse on this earth and they're black
I took it there, yeah, now let me bring it back
We all know on foreign shores that they finance wars
But ask yourself, ""Do they finance yours?""
When I first got mine I took them out on tour
Didn't know they lost half the value when I took 'em out the store
Or it was full of moissanites and cubits
But the jeweler knew I was stupid
And that I couldn't prove it
Feeling like I need it because I do music
To impress the groupies and the interviewers
So I didn't appraise it, nor did I loupe it
Even gave them to my girl, thinking I was Cupid
Homies was all hate, hoping they could make me lose it
Creeping through my own hood, knew I had to remove it
I see the Russian Mafia, the Jewish Mobsters
The undercover terrorists and the traps for the hustlers
Homie, it's a wrap for the nonsense rhyming

As I proceed to go dig through an old crib
Hold kids as I plunder through a pharaoh house
Thug Bones in gilded apparel piss
But arrow heads then let the marrow out
I literally won't leave litter since I've received the Brita
And when the sea leaves the land, who will feed the rivers, huh?
Crazy busy, make me, make me miss ya even when I'm with ya
If a phone calls in the club, but the music is too loud around to hear it
Do I still have to clear it?
Example: now I don’t let samples in my lyrics
Myth be told, 60 souls perished in the parish bill
Wrote a pair of wills on 50 scrolls with a pair of quills
Answered the question 'Americause?' Amerikills
Been living inside in envelopes with a pair of sills
Tall man like terror bills downfall from a pair of stilts wearin' heels, that's high
As I proceed to find silver line in a stalagmite
Cat eyes and scarab crowns on a black grace
Too wave, not to see bubonic plague in your rat face
Practice on the uttering until it lactates
Then begin the buttering of the pancakes
Push it to the margin flood the garden to the land lakes
Associate with mates who spit inside of they handshakes, yeah

'Cause I’m made from the best stuff on earth, like Snapple Tea Leaves
They glass is half full, so I spit into them like Celie

I’ve rocked it from the shottas to the soccer moms
Try to stop what’s going on
You’ll see the back of my hand like the tops of palms

Circle of influence getting bigger like the ripples on the tops of ponds
Sure-footed and war-headed like the tops of bombs

You might think this deep as fuck, but this is like my weaker stuff
They ask, ""Is this his day-to-day? 'cause this is like a week to us""

I is shy and he is up; I correct—me is up
No we is up, 'cause it's like two of me
And each of us rapping acid—eat this up
A-Town down, peace is up
New York to East Coast is cuffed; westside riding
Lot of niggas' salty 'cause, 'cause I be overseas and tough
Everything seamless, WorldStar never seen this
NahRight gotta stream this, motherfucking genius
Brave and fly; you backbone-less and wingless
Bunch of chickens on the strip—I’m coming for they fingers
'Til what they throwing up is meaningless
Chilly Chill, you seeing this? This didn’t make MTV’s list
Finish fingers, eating wrist, feeding frenzy and shit

That's right, to free Chilly Chill
And to do it all again, I would sign another deal
Still kinda paranoid from when they leaked my tape
Jeopardize being friendly just to keep mine safe
When keeping it real goes right, I couldn't keep my faith
By third album I was done, you shoulda seen my face
Fuck Craig, fuck rap, fuck this, fuck that
Fuck your 360 deal, nigga, that shit's wack
I was Truth.com with no backup plan
Got blackballed, couldn't find a job, tryna backup dance
That shit was crazy, thanks to my back-up fans

But that's the way it works, came to bring the pain, that's the way it hurts
Picking in the scabs from the past just gon' make it worse
Can't be 21 every time I sit and make a verse
When I did that song with NumbaNine, I was tryna break the curse
The good don't make it out of the hood unless the hood make it out you first
All you needs just to believe that you can leave
Crown B and Es made me believe that I could lead
Righteous deeds, planting seeds for good society
So you see that I can't be totally new
Cause there's a future Lupe out there that wanna be both of me too
And nobody really knows what the future holds
All the future sins for our future souls
And what I am doing now I couldn't do before

Old as yellow gold in a Chevrolet with a stick shift
The story goes his mother left him on a church step
First step was out the front door then the first left
Down the block to the spots where the worst kept
Thirty years later got a thirty tier caper
To shoot up the scene and scheme
Plot, broken all down to two rounds of scotch
A pound means now and we too down to stop
Say ya got enough round for two thousand cops
Military grade, these things shoot round the block
Shh threat, check
The dame will hang out like chains round the neck
He ever seen her before, her face don't connect
No, so keep it on the low, go
Seizes her by the arm
Looks right into the eyes cause these be the charms
Sheba, King Tut suite at the Khalifa
Tied to a chair getting burned by Cohibas
A well dressed thug who run clubs in the Koreas
The room smells like fresh hand made tortillas
He recognized the tattoos of a real big Maui brother
Known for bad news when his cash rules
Are you familiar with the shell of the cashews?
As he holds the needle up to the light bulb
White girls enter drunk, he stands up runs to the window and jumps
Aim for the pool... splash

The contract states from here upon you're dead
The girl at the bar is an underworld star
Settling on debts with north Zanzibar
Your name's on the list, kitsch
A hundred million dollars worth of high grade fish
Tuna, Tokyo cartels worlds biggest consumer
A rumor bout a schooner off the coast of Montezuma
They say you slit the throat of a well known kahuna
Then torched the boat and fled into the Dunya
You’re hated more than a Kalua pig at a Jumu'ah
They want your head on a platter, not right now but sooner
I got you a .45 and a Mitsubishi tuner
Wait, wait I've never been to Costa Rica
And then it all comes back
Just as Smearcon falls with a ninja star in his head like..huh
Then they slowly enter the room
I grabbed a .45, the ninja stars resume
I catch him in the cast and answer them with a blast, blow
Three more shots for good measure
Only exit is another window, pfft, whatever
Short fall to the roof of the car
Then I get in, left arm covered in ninja stars
Then a zero to a hundred baby real quick
Look around the car for something else to kill with
Lamborghini headlights in the rear view
These Parisian streets not meant to veer through
Especially with just one hand
I let go to shoot back but the gun jams
Mitsubishi not built to outrun Lambs
So they gaining, heavy raining
Rear view explodes from deadly aiming
Arm paining, blood draining
Pains, head for the Louvre
Drive right through the glass pyramid with dope moves
A little shook from the landing
Driving through the Louvre in a rally car with great handling
Was at the Mona Lisa
Stop the car right in front of the Delacroix and have a breather
Press play on the radio, voice from the speaker
Says get to Belgrade and take an ad out in the daily Politika
They says for a good time call this Ecuador slash Venezuelan chica
Next day at the airport meeted by a greeter who looks Corsican but Greeker
A little older wearing Michael Jordan sneakers
But I follow the leader
1995 S. Class, in the back seat is a dead man whose car I just crashed
Smearcon's alive, audience now wonders how Smearcon survived
Let alone not be hurt, he taps a metal plate in his head from his Afghanistan work
What Visine for red retinas, what else would you expect from head predators

Look like a million dollars off of signing with the Bears

Come, and bring the pieces to the master
He who organize by size then completes them with the plaster
Now, what should we call it?
After 12, cocktails prevails the inner alcoholic
Who knelt you by the toilets?
Remember, remember? Just like the Knights of Malta
Niggas like their liquor malted, manifested like a land without the Indian
Just all kith and foul kin
Whether Maltese or  Millennium
Saucer, Chaucer of the airwaves
Two assists: one Senegalese but her hair beige
The others hairs' shaved, both standing at the bottom of the staircase poised
But boys too coy to look in their face

<Lyric> 
She said love is a hard thing
Somewhere between golfing and gardening
Or parole board pardoning
But she was still down for a hard swing
Flowers she would pick like guitar strings
For a real good whiff
Of how life behind par seems
Until then she a bar-teend
And pour hot lead shots out of carbines
If an inmate ever even think about departing
Before it's time for the theft of a hard thing
Wanna see what a bum riding BART dreams
Before he get gunned down, cause some sharp scene
Saw it all on the way to the art scene
Around the time they kicked us out, they had the park cleaned
She ain't living in a car she just RV-ing
Life on ice like the San Jose Shark team
Hard times, tryna duck em like Darkwing
Known for burning clothes and petty car-keying
And other less harmful skylarking
Bought a bag out of American Rag
A small Chinese-made American flag
Took a dollar bill then split it in half
The picture that she bought wouldn't fit in the cab
On the train trying her best not to live in the past
A bum probably asked could he spit in her ass
And that was it, fits, tantrums random
Helter-Skelter, a world gone Manson",Lupe Fiasco|||Life Death and Love From San Francisco|||158,0,annoyance,approval,desire,"[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.9565786123275757}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.010844438336789608}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.009763519279658794}, {'label': 'desire', 'score': 0.0071732583455741405}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.005400163121521473}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.0047144899144768715}]"

Dinner is ceviche out of seashells
Annoyed cause her date really can't speak well
But she forced to press on like Lee Nails
Next table was abhorred by the weed smell
She was done at the moment that the tee fell
A thick wool jacket on a cool night
Unimpressed by poems or the moonlight
Doesn't satisfy her like a game of pool might
Thinking ""what if Fantasia had a broom strike?""
Tuned right out of that school life
Soon as reality became a camera crew and a boom mic
So what do you do like?
She said ""Absurd last words from a dude off a Zoosk site""
And then left him
Like the Roots left Geffen
And the state Howlin' Wolf left Chess in
Stop to watch flows have an unpaid session on the steps of a Westin
She really need to check in
And to apologize to her best friend
New bras to put her chest in
Love life and death in...

With the bass and the snare and the kick

Rap a couple bars, move your arms like— this
Your hand is a gun and your arm is a clip, let it rip
Don't get hit by the split-second Smith & Wesson lips
Full of hollow tips, please, tell the best on your list
That is death with a kiss
And they gotta swallow fire if they tryna follow this
With a style similar to ridin' around look for an arrest to resist
Ain't no rest for the wit, no recess for the gift
It's like I don't do it for the check or the chip
I protect and predict what the next going to flip
I address, then I rip, get respect, then I dip

<Lyric> 
When your spirit is strained
And you limited to change
The lyrics in your limericks'll change
A different hook, the way the sentences arranged
More demented in your deliverance, more sinister in your slang
Sounds more belligerent when it's sang
The truth is limitless in its range
If you drop a 'T' and look at it in reverse it can hurt
Look at the grimaces of the pain
And it's worse when it works and your membership is gained
But you forgetting the proof diminishes in the flames
Like 'poof', the media pours images in your brain
Of the score of the war where militants is slain
The faces of the guilty where innocence is proclaimed
And they filthy, the deaf ears are the winners
The listeners are the lames
Of the ballad of the man that the son of a minister has became

Got 'em clothes up the flow then taught 'em how to dress
Made a space so they can milk this way
Had 'em open up the udders
Broken off hat had folks in all colors
I wish a nigga would try and open y'all shutters
Cartier frames, Aoki on a shirt in the red and white chukkas
Why you goin' all hard though?
NASCAR star got bars by the carload
You know LF won to come out the top
But for this ten, I'ma just open up the car door
And my deepness
Might spit the stash box sequence that'll open up the cargo
If I break it down to you lil' homie, might get a nigga car towed
You ain't gotta worry 'bout ours though

And I might drop SKULLS as an art show

So I can sit you in a position from which I see it

Which means you somewhere in between it
I take it back for you like the Wyld Stallyns of San Dimas

But without the 'Ye, but his last name's my side

I done it, as well as a celebrated alumnus
I donate to the campus, and my name's on the arenas
But you can't bring it to my court—not even with subpoenas
'Cause you can't play my sport, but you can still cheerlead us
And you can't sit there—that section's for the seniors
And the sexy señoritas, so, just move up to the bleachers
How you gonna school me when I grew up with your teachers?
I know that you can't hear me 'cause I blew up all the speakers
And the power line is hanging 'cause I threw up all the sneakers
I ate up the imposters and I chewed through all the pizzas
I blacked out with a black card and I maxed out all the Visas, ugh
Accreditation so prestigious
Just walk across my stage—your life will be completed
Don't need financial aid, 'cause this is just some free shit
You been properly prepared, throw your hats up in the air
I'm red hot, Chilly—I'm Anthony Kiedis
My spirit smells teenage, and Chi-Town's feeling excellent

I just sit them next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her titties out
And what's written on her titties is what it's really about
Then, her vagina is some poor kids from China
Nipples, nuclear missiles
Ass is a daughter without a dad
Back is like Afghanistan, Iraq
Health care hair, drive-by thighs

Environment feet; justice get her so wet
Brains get you brains, you can fuck her if you protest
But before you bust in her face

And fast-forwards bullets makin'a B-line for my face
Then they stop like Neo
Laugh at me throw some cash at me then fly pass me
But one ricochets off the wall to come back and ask me
Am I scared of him or the ""nigga that blast me""
Or maybe just the hammer that goes to be a hole in an innocent bystander
My eye's a camera my ear's a microphone
My mind is Pro Tools my head is a stool
Whats recorded in my dome gets reported when I zone
My mouth is a speaker I'm anchoring the misery
There's no friends the enemy of my enemy is my enemy
Beakers and test tubes full of memories
In my laboratory I create stories
Doze off then wake up surrounded by Forties
Wit Glocks tucked in they labels
And they caps is baseball hats
Playin poker at a table
Cigarettes massage they shoulders in belly tops showin off they navels
A dime sack side bets, a tech is runnin' for president
Jesus pieces walk around with niggas hangin' from they necks
Monopoly is playin' chess
I just picked up an obituary of a bullet proof vest
Put the headphone on my mouth speak into my ears
Yeah, microphone check, check, check, check, check, check
A pair of Air Forces told me Rims've been extinct for years
Been ethnic cleansed by Jersey's tryna take over the set
And Television is on deathrow for killing BET and MTV over a dice game
And paralyizing CNN by knifing him in the neck
I hear Clear Channel's been fightin' him in the rec
Who's in for givin' grape Kool-Aid laced with strychnine to mixtapes and arm robbin' cassettes
Dope told me Weed was a crack fiend but Crack told me that Dope was a base head
Hi-hats told police he was just a soldier he did what the Bass said
The Snare and the Kick didn't make it out alive
The Sample made it out with some money but he died in the ride
The 808 got caught wit some work (He ain't never comin' home)
So the MPC's and the MP3's is fightin over his turf
Sean Don just gave birth
But she's thinkin' bout leavin it on the doorstep of a church
Cristal can't have kids she plottin' to kidnap it that she orchestrated with a purse
But Gucci told Fendi and Fendi turned and around and told Henny
And Henny is Moets baby's father
But she tried it anyway disguised as a nurse
In the newspapers it says ""Hip-Hop called Rock n Roll racist""
The Six ripped the Five and the Maybach taped it
A Hundred dollar bill just signed a record deal
But he blew all his money on the Braceletes
And givin' the Gold Dollar a face lift
A Button Up just drove by in a 6-4 Impalla
All the Rolex's is hatin' you see the smirks on they faces
The Havatampas is defending the Dutchess they keep catchin cases
But the judge is a Swisha he just give em iBonds and community service with the Papers
So the Newport's is gettin mad at the ZigZags then out come the razors
See the Kool's is killers on the creep
Rush up on the Philly, leave his guts spillin on the street
Some Gold Grills burned down the building of some teeth
Some Sharpened Tooth Brushes is holding the trampoline cuz some children finna to leap
I just seen Rocawear rock Sean John to sleep with the same heat that Baby Phat carried
Sprint is pimpin Nextel she just gave head to a Black Berry
I heard she go two-ways
But he was skeetin on her face as it was beepin on my waist

Upset stomach on the boat to Lucerne to see the lion
Carved in the wall by the pond
To commemorate the soldier dying over old divines
Ergo sum empire, not the inch but the entire
More pills mean more spills by the whore house with the extra door
To let the divorced out with force
And other course routes, of course
Cleopatra speaking patois with a mouth full of that jerk chicken
With rum in hand for the curse lifting
Onion bread with the shine to it
It's up and fair to define stupid
But she ain't dumb, at least she know that he ain't fun
And neither's Europe, even to the Middle Eastern tourists
Where oil is spent by the drum load
How many millionaires can the slums hold?
Potentially all of us, this whole plane and all the bus
As juggernauts bust through a wall of trust
You strain to see through the fog of dust
Like spaghetti for the meatballs
Of dust Parmesan immaculates
Head over heels like a back is flipped
The Japanese don’t perceive Atlanta-ness
Love labors, get her backstage like the judge chambers
Everyone under the sun loves hugs from a young stranger
Or do us, oh foo us
On boats in the Bay of Pigs
Runaways wait with the wayward kids
And the underpaid slaves from Jamaican gigs
Don't shoe us, cause we ain't Bush
We ain't hoofs don't boo us cause we ain't cooked
But who else could hook the fufu up
In this book I mean, dumplings with dark continents
Dumb things even bar common sense
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes a terpin intertwines with the turbans
Vines with turbans and removes the minds of serpents
Detergents, deterrents and permits, to build a hut
Twerk team, Operation Build-a-Butt
Great like Gildersleeve
As a king breathes through a silver sieve
Jack and Jill ain't up that hill enough
Filtering lean through a gold grill
Theorize things from swole hills
They came became what that po' kills
Throw ho drills on that hotel, that'll oil spill
Looking at space from a submarine
Putting that bass in the club machine
Pushing that cake till it mush in that face ain't no love between
Fancy ass man wearing glove and rings
Flying round town in a tub of wings
Found out how to make love to fiends
He mixing that fudge with the drug of dreams
She too teenage to have a drug of choice
But she fuck with that Royce like she love Detroit

Too many best-rappers, not enough best-rhymes, though
Guess I'm delusional, used to doing it all the time, so
Maybe I'm just jaded, out of touch and unrelated
Unable to connect greatness based on the person who makes it
Or maybe I just hate it
And that would make me hater
Maybe it is great but that don't mean it's greater
Having your profile raised doesn't make you a raiser
Being ambiguous with assertions, isn't making you safer
What you mean, though?
Line us up, paddling us on the back
Like we steamboat, you president of the frat
You goin' sling toast, like you Ringo
And you think Doc Holliday's
Just goin' tolerate and too sick to let that thing go
It's just a matter of returns
Ashes to ashes, scattered them from the urns
To start a fire shaky to gather them from the burned
And reassemble these ashes, the blackness is something firm
Then moving blackness backwards in the bread of some other shit
Any deep we spreadin' wheat seeds from a bucket shit
McDonald had a farm and he lovin' it
Rolls Royce of the scented voice against the arms of the government
Artists gettin' robbed for their publishing
By dirty Jewish execs that think his alms from the covenant
I'll retire when I'm tired, that's a Firestone death
Easy to say when nobody's there, like a microphone check
They wanna hear what I'm gon' say before the microphone check
Make me sign an NDA before the microphone test

Can find its way home if you forget it
Say, maybe on a starship tour
Heard a knock at your starship door
It was the girl that you had met at the starship bar
Had a dance on the starship floor
But then you got starship sick
So you had to run to the starship store
And then you got those starship pills
But when you back, she wasn't there no more
She says, ""Hope you got a starsuit at the starship store
Maybe we can take a trip
To take a look at the stars around parsec 4""
And it was the most beautiful thing
You both had ever seen in your lives before
And she pulled out her love

Drill music, pop that pill music, kill music
Desecrating the temples in the ghetto
Funeral processionals increase their frequency
Because we can't break the spell of Geppetto
No one knows
And scrolls of obituaries contain more words than dictionaries
That will define how lions in Zion became alley cats
Who traded their baseball bats for gats that spat
Blood of the people across steeples
And concrete jungles that turn playgrounds into graveyards
That buriеd generations of Black and Brown men who lеft their post
Because they were misguided by ghosts in the land of the living
Ready, aim, fire
Wanna be the block, but can't buy the block, bulldozin' the block
Makin' the Red Sea choke on bones of drones
Sent by PPP loans to see how you spent the money
Left, left, right, left
To figure it out while the ancestors watch and aid those who call out to them
Through altars, pay phones, saxophones, bottles of liquor, glasses of water
The sum of a son and a daughter equals new life, the holy trinity
He was a baby boy, but he was kin to me
Born to Basimah in hands of the lion who said
""Store your water in the basement, because one day, it will be scarce and polluted""
He said, ""One day, grocery stores will be baren
Learn how to grow your own food and don't get caught starin'
Down the barrel of a gun
Learn how to run underground drills in Zion""
To be reborn lest you be scorned by the ways of the wicked
Who pillage our communities and natural resources for profit
He said, ""My children, each of you are prophets""
Don't let money be the sum of your deeds
Pull the weeds from your mind
Look to the front, the side, and behind
You each have blades that will drill a new earth
Manifest the new world that Columbus thought he found
Band together to reverse the weather to unite the seeds of the oppressed
Stand together and work righteously to be blessed
For generations to come
Drill down, Zion is in you",Lupe Fiasco|||THE LION’S DEEN|||183,0,annoyance,approval,realization,"[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.9536567330360413}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.027678336948156357}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.020249467343091965}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.0096599655225873}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.007435696665197611}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.005534397903829813}]"

Behind the mic like the wheel of a vehicular killer
The threading, put it together like a three minutes to wedding
In less than three minutes of meddling, over melody and grand piano peddlings
I do represent the mind like IQs, intelligent signs in our kinds of haiku
Cobra Kai turn high top fade to Caillou, who inspect a man stance and fight the kaiju
Way beyond a hundred kicks, breaking bottom bricks and he on number six
This is that “there should be a name for it”
Hideo should go and make a game for it
Mama should make you change for it
Kinda rap that sends jaguars running back into the rain forest
Plans over panic, when Superman scans deadpan over planets
Make the fat man hand over the ham jam and lamb and Spam sandwich

And I flood your watch flooded like a basement man
You and my main foes fold like clean clothes

You ain't gotta have your hands up

Then I ran round touched money, changed my mind
Mind on my change so I tucked money hands down
Now, in addition to the semi
There's paper on the waist like Henry
And niggas ain't seeing what I'm keeping concealed
They wanna be it, chill; you would leak it if the secret's revealed
Peep it, might leak it to polices and squeal
Then you gotta hide money like
Fresh or witness protect
Went from, best to business exec in less than 4!
You can get it in the chest like Fresh
Anything not next to Tec is hidden in the floor
So act like you Denzel or Rudy Ray Moore
Wait, there's more:
Let me catch you tappin' my floor like Savion or Morse
Hope you like the sound of hollow, I got more
I black out like DOS, how you gonna back out
There's no back doors, like Porsche

He had to part then, left with only a mother
The family structure suffers
He will soon cling to hustlers, as his guardians
He still a boy, needs to fill a void, marchin'
Up the block up to no good, sellin' in the wrong hood
He was taken down by a marksmen

That now have babies that lack Pampers
No Kwaanzas and they lack Santas
And the father who thinks shoe-shopping is the answer
Skipped out on parenthood classes so
She don't know how to handle her
And never learned from her grandmother
One day got hot, couldn't take it
Dropped her in a vacant lot

See the shapes these little girls is gettin'?
Some say the steroids in the chicken is
The cause of the thickening in the young women
Livid, see some shorties playin' Cops & Robbers, livin'
Bittersweet thoughts is what I had for them
I can picture quota fillin' Police chasin' after them
Catchin' up to, friskin' and askin' them
Where the packs at? Who yo' chief
Is? Where the straps at?
Am I thinking too hard? Or perhaps that's reality
In a project mentality, but through it all
I hope we learn more than how to be
Whores and how to move a ball

I mean drop like the temperature
Then rock on right through the winter
Put something on they mind, give em lines to remember
Aw! a lifetime remembered, which is mine
Then recorded, put it in Georges then rewind then look into
My mis-adventures, adventures into the Underworld
Hanging with them Cover Girls, this ain't my enter, nawww
On Arista, I coulda been a contender
But BMG had a different agenda
What up, LA Reid? I still see ya
You still my homeboy, won't even charge ya for a feature
I went from MC to being MS
That's ""microphone controller"" to ""motivational speaker""
Niggas...
Astaghfirullah, I'm not a prophet
But Fahrenheit 1/15 is being quoted by preachers
Far from being a leader, but I'm still being invited by teachers
With no Hennessy, and no reefer
Give him a hand, I came from hand-me-down sneakers
And I don't wanna boast or brag
But for what most niggas hope, a nigga done had
Chop game with my folk and split it in half
You ain't gotta bring it back tomorrow, a nigga can have
Rich or broke, a nigga ain't mad
Self-esteem will make a Regal ride like a Silver Seraph
Just wipe the french fries off the seat
Lean back, and I tilt my hat, uh!
And nod my head to the baseline
Freebase to the 8 times at Baseline watching Jay put it together
I wonder if he knew
While he was mumbling that this would push Lupe forever
Together, with the FNF crew
Atlantic on post, proudly present to you, uh!
Some new, something fresh, something different
A lil to the left, a lil upliftin'
A lil good game, a lil hustlin' in it
Some SB Nikes, some nice crushed linen
Don't forget the skateboard, of course, the nice women
Can I get a mic check? And a lil light dimming?
And a fresh bottle of Voss, maybe with some light lemon?
And you gotta blame my momma for the lil light-skinning
And this ain't written, I swear, Autumn
I was just recording 'em as I thought em
A YG, FNF U-P
23-year-old VP
With a flow like Laudanum, that'll getcha sleepy
But soon as they nod off, that's when I smelling-salt 'em
What up, Madison Street?
How they gonna keep us off them? PEACE

<Lyric> 
They tryin' to censor the influencer
Just makes me sicker, influenza, yeah
I'll abide by the censorship
Soon as they ride I'll get back on my nigga shit
Can't reverse
The boy-game Advanced, complete the genesis
I've broke bread with societies menaces
I've dedicated sentences to the dead, and said hold your heads to my niggas doin’ sentences
I send condolences to the victims but, threats to the witnesses
On my path I was facing a paragraph, myself
So they sentiments is felt
When you hate your own and discriminate of self
In a cell gotta make your home, coz you might never make it home
Suicide on your side might commit it with your belt
Keep your pants on homie
Streets are damn so lonely, like only
A bunch of niggas won’t help, nah
That’s the enemy of stealth
Plus if they get caught how you gonna keep your heart fatigue
The hustler’s diet is the enemy of health, give you heart disease
Arteries hard but its hard to leave the bread alone
Aren’t we hard headed, headed for harm, but don’t fret it homes
From the twist tied to the butt
We be rippin’ it up
From the horror to the cure, don’t force the issue
To you my niggas in the war, may the force be with you",Lupe Fiasco|||Jedi Mind Tricks|||194,0,annoyance,sadness,disapproval,"[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.6479010581970215}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.10019417852163315}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.09012290090322495}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.06686264276504517}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.05433625355362892}, {'label': 'caring', 'score': 0.037584275007247925}]"

So I'm gon' ghost-ride, but with no sheets

Like hotel swimming pools: That's four feet
These niggas like the rooms: so suite

I'm a cell phone, they some room keys
I'm some shelltoes, they the shoestrings
I turn 'em off (I turn 'em off), I take 'em out (I take 'em out)

That's your ship sinking, and I'm so afloat

For that BP, I shed fifty tears
In Nigeria, that oil been spilling for like fifty years

Tell me what's gon' happen when them stores close (Close)

Hunger's your enemy, but you can't kill that

And they ain't even real, or are they?
But you ain't even know, because you par-tay—
Too fucking much; if you start to doubt—
They already in your mind, and coming out your mouth
It's not a trick (Nigga), nigga, it's a trap (Trap)
Survival of the fit (Fit) is what they aiming at
And niggas ain't fit (Nope): fat as hell (Yep)
Fat in mind (Yep); body fat, as well
Who use most the drugs? Americans
What's in Afghanistan? Heroin
You think that's by mistake? They can stop that
Don't think you safe, though, because you not Black
Greed is colorblind, so I'm colorblind
They gon' fuck with yours soon as they done with mine
They say I try too hard (Hard), verses overwhelm ('Whelm)
I learned most of this from niggas sitting in jail
Where you think I'm from? I'm from the streets, nigga
Triple OGs told me to teach, nigga
And that ain't made up (Nope), that's a fact (Yep)
They say that gangsta shit is the shit I rap
Look who I attract, look at my inner circle
Bunch of street niggas and a couple Urkels
Look at my fanbase—oh, yes
Fuck what Pro say—look at this protest
Where they do that at? (Huh?) Who they do that for? (For)
Must mean I'm doin' bad, and things is movin' slow (No)
We talkin' revolution on public radio
Then catch me down in Houston, sitting on them eighty-fours
