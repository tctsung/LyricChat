California sobrio en la autopista 1
Más allá del arcén, pensé que vi algo divertido, ¿buscas que te lleven?
Problemas con algunas margaritas, sosteniendo su pulgar
Robó el dinero de un tonto, ahora está huyendo y quiere drogarse
Ella dijo: ""Te llevaré a un pequeño viaje, vamos, prueba estos labios""
Ella se bebió todo mi whisky, sopló todo mi humo
Me convertí en el remate de alguna broma cósmica
Maldita botella estaba seca, como que quería llorar
Ella susurró, ""Detente,"" Yo dije, ""Tú eres el jefe""
Con un acento sureño, dijo, ""Aquí es donde me bajo"", He disfrutado nuestro tiempo
Ella dijo, ""Cariño, dame un beso más antes de despedirte de tu trasero""",Post Malone|||California Sober (Traducción al Español)|||245,0
