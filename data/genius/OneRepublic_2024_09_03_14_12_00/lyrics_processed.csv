Depuis toujours, le sens nous l'avons cherché
Nous avons construit, nous avons détruit, nous avons conquis
Nous avons cédé à la violence de l’homme nourrie par la peur
Mais c'est dans notre nature d'être propulsé par l'espoir
Durant les nuits où défilent nos frayeurs, nous prions pour qu’elles nous amènent plus loin, plus vite
Vers une imperceptible utopie
Nous sommes un miracle semblable à l’aube et ses manières
Semblable à l’équilibre de notre système solaire
Semblable à la gravité qui nous maintient sur terre
Alors cherche la lumière et tu verras, tu n’es pas tout seul
Nous sommes une imparfaite réussite, pleine de fissures et de compromis
Nous avons besoin l’un de l’autre, nous avons besoin d’appartenir désespérément

<Lyric> 
This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
It's time to make our move, I'm shakin' off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands, just take the wheel...
And every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead",OneRepublic|||Stop and stare - live from dortmund|||175,0

I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see",OneRepublic|||Stop and stare - live from dortmund|||175,1

Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could...
Steady feet, don't fail me now
I'm gonna run till you can't walk
But something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down...",OneRepublic|||Stop and stare - live from dortmund|||175,2
