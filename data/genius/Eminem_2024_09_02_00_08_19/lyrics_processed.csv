Dealin' with, DJ Whoo Kid
Lifestyle, flash
I see all of these, you know, these weak cats on here archin' they eyebrows
Next time I catch a nigga,  they eyebrows arched I’ma slap the shit out of them","Eminem|||10, 9, 8|||0",0
"Eminem|||10, 9, 8|||0|||1",Eminem,"10, 9, 8","Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Ready or not here we come, here comes trouble in the club
Eleven, twеlve, thirteen, pistols big as M-16s
How the fuck we snеak in with this many heaters in our jeans?
Nina, two ninas, a piece, they don't even see us
Some shit pops off we squeeze each one
They're gonna think it's machine guns
Vandals-vo-vandals, bananas and old flannels
Hands around our Colt handles, hold them like Roman candles
So ban us, go ban us, banana-fanna-fo-fannas
Who come back all bananas, banana clips loaded
Managers, bouncers, and the club owners
The motherfuckers don't want us to come up, bum rush in the club
And run up in it with a bunch of motherfuckers from Runyon
Steady popping them onions
Ready, set to go nut up, prepare to tear the whole club up
Fixing to get into some shit, just itching to choke someone up
You know we finna loc'n when we mix coke with coconut rum up
So, yeah, yeah, ho, what up? See my people posted up
See you talk that ho shit now, when you're down you won't get up
And can't sit up you're so slit up, the ambulance won't sew you up
They just throw you up in the trunk once they tag your big toe up
Heater-no-heater, automatic-no-matic
Mag or no mag, it don't matter if I have or don't have it
You never know when I'm packing so you just don't want no static
And open up a whole can of whoop ass
You don't wanna chance to risk it, no biscuit
Milli mac or mac milli
Will he, won't he, don't be silly, homie you don't know me really
You're just gonna make yourself dizzy wonderin' what the dilly
Fuck it, let's just get busy D-Twizzy's back in the hizzy!","Eminem|||10, 9, 8|||0",1
"Eminem|||10, 9, 8|||0|||2",Eminem,"10, 9, 8","Git up now! Let's get it cracking, yeah, it's on and poppin'
Bitch, D12 is back in this bitch, ugh! There ain't no stoppin'
We're gonna get it crackalating, what you waiting for?
The wait is over, say no more
Quit tryna play the wall and quit hatin'
Git up now! Y'all are still sitting? What the fuck, are you deaf?
You motherfuckers don't listen I said
We 'bout to get this motherfucker crackalatin'
Quit procrastinatin'
What the fuck you waiting for? Get off the wall and quit hatin', bitch
Git up now!

<Lyric> 
T's only fair to warn
I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella to Mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar
With your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid Darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To Receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants
And given a lеss than 20 percent chance of living
Havе a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in Grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you
While you scream ""I'M STILL ALIVE!""
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired an arson to set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment",Eminem|||1997|||3,0

<Lyric> 
Everybody, duck down, all you hear is the sound
Of Slim Shady spittin' rounds at the Lyricist Lounge
What year is this now? I don't know, I forgot
All I know is that I'd die for pot, make the cypher hot
Smoke weed and fuck up my life a lot
Give me the money now, bitch
Did you want to see your wife or not?
'Fore I stab her wit' this knife I got
I got a sci-fi plot like a science fiction flick that I'm a hit you wit'
I got the Outsidaz up in this bitch
Peace to Thirstin' Howl, A.L. and Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack, I had a premature birth
I'm just a nerd cursed wit' badly disturbed nerves
Who wanna step to this and get served first?
Ninety-nine percent of aliens prefer Earth
So I'm here to rule the planet, startin' wit' your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a word search
Wit' smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts
Rappers can't fuck wit' me, it hurts worth
When they get abolished, polyps'll murk worse
Wrote a secret message inside of a word search
Wit' smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts
Rappers can't fuck wit' me, hollerin', 'Nurse, nurse'
You said this shot would numb it, bitch, it just hurts worse
Rappers can't fuck wit' the way that I spit it, lyrical lit it
Now you did it when I committed, get his rhymes out here
Off the top of the dome wit' a popular poem
Fuck a team, I can stop you alone
Rappers don't understand it","Eminem|||1997 Freestyle Live at Wetlands, NYC|||4",0
