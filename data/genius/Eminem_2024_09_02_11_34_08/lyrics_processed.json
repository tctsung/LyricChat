Plus, I just kind of thought of the idea a little too late. But I've been drawing since I was 10, and I thought you might like it. Anyways, thank you for always being so kind to me. You are a true Queen, and I mean that in every sense of the word. I will never forget the opportunities you have given me. You will always be in my heart, my thoughts, and my prayers. As I have said before, you have no idea how much your son and his music has inspired, not only the \"Hip Hop\" world, but, speaking for myself, has inspired my whole career. He was, and still is, the true definition of a \"Soldier.\" When I was feeling at my worst; (before fame, before Dre) I knew I could put that \"2Pac\" tape in, and suddenly, things weren't so bad. He gave me the courage to stand up and say \"F**k the world!\" \"This is who I am! And if you don't like it, go f**k yourself!\" Thank you for giving us his spirit, and yours!

    "Eminem|||My Drug Addiction|||330": "I don't know what point exactly it started to be a problem, I just remember liking it more and more, whenever people would try to help me I would say get that fucking person outta here, I can't believe they said that shit to me, they don't know anything about me or my life. It's not like I'm out here snorting coke or shooting heroin up my arm.\n\nIt's either you have a problem and can you control it or you can't, I literally thought I could control it until I overdosed during Christmas of 2007. Had I got to the hospital about two hours later, I would have died. My organs were shutting down. My liver, kidneys, everything. They were gonna have to put me on dialysis, they didn\u2019t think I was gonna make it.\n\nI remember coming out of rehab and relapsing and shooting right back up to where I was when I overdosed. I was ransacking my whole house just looking for a stash of Vicodin that I maybe hidden away and then I found some in my basement wrapped up it was the extra strength ones.\n\nAfter I got out of rehab I did not sleep for three week straights I mean like not even nodding off for a fucking minute I would just sit up and stare at my TV.\n\nI would walk around my house and thinking every single day, \"I'm gonna fucking die.\" I'm looking at my kids, and like, I need to be here for them. I'm growing. I just couldn\u2019t believe that anybody could be naturally happy or naturally function or be just enjoying life in general without being on something\n\nThe doctors told me I'd done the equivalent of four bags of heroin,\nI was addicted Valium, Ambien, the numbers got so high I didn't even know what I was taking anymore. It never once hit me that drug addiction runs in my family, now that I understand that I\u2019m an addict, I definitely have compassion for my mother. I get it now.\n\nI wanted to make an overall statement \u2014 I\u2019m back. It was a slow process. You gotta remember I hadn\u2019t recorded a song sober in seven years. So it took me a while to even feel like I could record a song sober \u2026 I don\u2019t know the last time I shot a video sober, without drinking or taking anything. It\u2019s been years.\n\nI almost feel like a little kid again with rap, I wanna play around with different flows. If I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s what I\u2019m fully capable of, if there\u2019s one weak line, I wanna change it. Rap was my drug It used to get me high and then it stopped getting me high. Then I had to resort to other things to make me feel that. Now rap\u2019s getting me high again.\n\nSo I would say to anybody, it does get better, you know. It just does.",

    "Eminem|||The Monster Explained|||368": "You have reached the voicemail box of: Suck it\n\nHey, Em. What's going on? It's Paul. Uh, I wanted to call you to let you know we're getting ready to shoot the \"Monster\" video. We got dates for Rihanna and she's gonna come out to Detroit and we can get it shot. We've got some concepts together based on your conversations with Rich Lee and I think we're ready to go.\n\nSo the basic concept is sort of like an Inception-type of vibe. The whole video sort of happens inside of your head and Rihanna, in the beginning, is gonna act as your therapist. And you answer into her office, you sit down and you sort of fall asleep or drift off; we're not really sure. And next thing you know, you're travelling in this elevator and the elevator sort of represents your journey and your career. And there's various stops along the way. We're gonna recreate some scenes from some of your classic moments.\n\nI had to go home and get my straightjacket. Redoing this scene actually brings back no memories for me because I don't remember it. Dr Dre would say, \"I'm glad to see you got your coat back on. The way things should be.\"\n\nThe scene from the \"My Name Is\" video, with you in the straightjacket and Dre as your therapist in the psychiatrist's office there.The song which recieved an Oscar for you ,yes \"Lose yourself\" will also be included. We're gonna go back and revisit \"The Way I Am\", with you jumping off the building, falling through the sky, with everything moving past you. And then we're also gonna do the classic Grammy scene, with you and Elton John performing \"Stan\".\n\n\"I can't see it all. Even if I could, it'll all be grey. But your picture on my wall, it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad\".\n\nSo, all these things are going on in your head. You're travelling through the elevator, looking at it from a new perspective, with you watching yourself. And then when you finally get to the end of your journey in the elevator, you come out and you see this sort of caged beast. And the beast is actually Slim Shady.\n\nSlim Shady's inside of this cage and you walk up and you don't really know what's going on. And then you see it's actually yourself. And Slim Shady's feeding you some notes and we can just assume that the notes might be some lyrics or some song titles scribbled on them. And the idea that you keep feeding Slim Shady with fame and all of the things that go along with it. And the songs'll keep coming back out.\n\nSo, it's really kind of a trip. It's very surreal. Less performance than some of your recent videos but this is more cinematic and it's more of a story through this journey.\n\nSo, anyway. Call me back after you listen to this. Um, I sent the treatment over, read through it and get ready for some really long days. Later.\n\nI'm done. It's a wrap. Uh, I never want to perform in these clothes again. Way too small. I'm try'na go, like, quadruple X next time. So, these clothes are a fucking wrap too. Peace out.\n\nAnd goodnight. Give it up for him, folks. Thank you very much.",

We just worked out it was meant to be at this time. I think it's unlike any current hip hop songs. If you listen to what's going on in hip hop, this is not what this is. Em wanted to do something kind of throwback to some of the early records that we were making in the old days. And it more reflects that energy of the early days of hip hop.\n\nWe were in the studio working on a bunch of different ideas and this was one of the later ones to come up. It started with a sample and the sample that we started with ended up not being in the record. The song sort of evolves. It started one way, it kind of got programmed and written to and then it changed into a whole different song.\n\nAnd I felt the track was really strong and didn't really know what direction Em was gonna go in vocally. And then when I heard the vocals, that was pretty, exciting because it was not at all what I was expecting. And just the energy in it and the lyrics and the style of it. It's so well done and so smart and so funny. It's just great. In this song, we ended up using a wired guitar and hook and everything else pretty much is programmed.\n\nIt reminds me of old hip hop videos and I think it's really entertaining and I look forward to see it all put together and done. But in the shooting stages, the pieces I've seen look really entertaining.",
