Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you

<Lyric> 
""Hey, Nate, how's life?""
I don’t know, it's alright
I've been dealin’ with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night (Last night)
""I'm sorry,"" that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah (Bus rides)
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny’s goin’ on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out (Air out)
I’ve been searchin'
""What does that mean, Nate?"" I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin’ my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey (But hey)
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it? (You seen it?)
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm sayin', and—
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean off my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up outta nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great—not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith, woo
I've been developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah (Ah)
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me ""Tone that down,"" but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist

<Lyric> 
Yeah, when I grow up, you know what I wanna be?
Take a seat, let me tell you my ridiculous dreams
I wanna rap, yeah, I know it's hard to believe
And I can tell you're already thinkin' I will never succeed
But I'm okay with it, I admit the lyrics are weak
I've been workin' on 'em, I'll be good eventually
I understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet
But I been running for a while, they ain't ready for me, ahh
I know this prolly isn't really realistic
And honestly, I might not ever make a difference
But that don't make a difference, I'ma have to risk it
I've been crunchin' numbers, you ain't gotta be a mathematician
To see the odds ain't rootin' for me
I can't lie though, it's kinda how I like it to be
The underdog, yeah, you prolly think you know what I mean
But what I'm saying is they ever push me, I'm gonna swing, yeah
I could go to college, get in debt like everybody else
Graduate and prolly get a job that doesn't pay the bills
That don't make a lot of sense to me, forget the Happy Meals
I don't like the dollar menu, I would rather make a meal
Huh? Make a mil'? Nah, I said make a meal
Home-cookin', get the grill, how you want it? Pretty well?
Everything I see is overdone to me, I'm not Adele

<Lyric> 
Clicks, clicks, clicks, they'll do anything to get a few
Tick, tick, tick, that's the sound before my head explodes
Quit, quit, quit, look at you up on your pedestals
Quick, quick, quick, here the critics come, it's time to go
I read your article, it kinda hurt me
I don't know who hired you or what your friends say in your circle
But the fact that you released it tells me two things are for certain
They get paid for trashin' people, I get paid 'cause I stay workin' (Yeah)
Dropped The Search and they emerge up outta nowhere to the surface
Just to peek behind the curtain, throwin' salt at all my burdens
I'm aware I shouldn't give this my attention, life's a journey
I should just stay on my path and learn to laugh, you think they heard me?
Ears are burning, put 'em out, quiet, quiet, look around
Why don't they find someone way more interesting to write about?
Us, we're kinda boring, aren't we? All we do is whine and pout
It's confusing, so amusing how I argue with myself
Hello
I spit it with ease, so leave it to me
You doubt it, but you better believe
I'm on a rampage, hit 'em with the record release
Depend on the week, I'm prolly gonna have to achieve
Another goal, let me go when I'm over the beat
I go into beast mode, like I'm ready to feast
I'm fed up with these thieves, tryna get me to bleed
They wanna see me take an L, yep, see what I mean?
How many records I gotta give you to get with the program?
Taken for granted, I'm 'bout to give you the whole plan
Open your mind up and take a look at the blueprint
Debate if you gotta, but gotta hold it with both hands
To pick up the bars, you gotta be smart
You really gotta dig in your heart
If you wanna get to the root of an issue
Pursuin' the mental can be dark and be difficult
But the pay off at the end of it can help you to get through it, ayy",NF|||PAID MY DUES|||5,0,confusion,annoyance,disappointment,"[{'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.35681039094924927}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.35209858417510986}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.21094755828380585}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.12657864391803741}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.07428377121686935}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.07282637804746628}]"

I don't want no one to know I'm vulnerable; why? (Woo)
That makes me feel weak and so uncomfortable; why? (Ayy)
Stop askin' me questions, I just wanna feel alive
Until I die—this isn't Nate's flow (Woo)
Just let me rhyme; I'm in disguise
I'm a busy person, got no time for lies; one of a kind
They don't see it; I pull out they eyes; I'm on the rise!
I've been doin' this for most my life with no advice (Woo)
Take my chances, I just roll the dice, do what I like
As a kid, I was afraid of heights, put that aside
Now I'm here and they look so surprised, well so am I, woo
They don't invite me to the parties, but I still arrive
Kick down the door and then I go inside
Give off that ""I do not belong here"" vibe
Then take the keys right off the counter, let's go for a ride
Why do y'all look mortified? (Ayy)
I keep to myself, they think I'm sorta shy, organized
""Let You Down's"" the only song you've heard of? Well then you're behind (Woo)

If I should stick my knife inside of Pennywise
I, I don't care what anybody else thinks—lies (Haha)
I do not need nobody to help me—lies
I kinda feel guilty 'cause I'm wealthy; why?
I don't understand, it's got me questionin' like
""Why? Just tell me why""—not back to this flow
Inside I feel divided
Back when I ain't had a dime, but had the drive
Back before I ever signed, I questioned life, like, ""Who am I, man?"" Woo
Nothin' to me's ever good enough
I could be workin' for 24 hours a day and think I never did enough
My life is a movie, but there ain't no tellin' what you're gonna see in my cinema (No)
I wanna be great, but I get in the way of myself and I think about everything that I could never be
Why do I do it though? Ayy, yeah
Why you always lookin' aggravated?
Not a choice, you know I had to make it
When they talk about the greatest, they gon' probably never put us in the conversation
Like somethin', then I gotta take it
Write somethin', then I might erase it
I love it, then I really hate it
What's the problem, Nathan? I don't know!
I know I like to preach to always be yourself (Yeah)
But my emotions make me feel like I am someone else
Me and pride had made a pact that we don't need no help
Which feels like I'm at war inside myself, but I forgot the shells
I hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
A lot of people know me, but not a lot know me well
Hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
A lot of people know me, but they don't know me well

<Lyric> 
What, are you scared of me? It's embarrassing
If it wasn't for me, you woulda never wrote Therapy
I've been here for you, but how come you're never there for me?
It's a little bit twisted, but I miss when you and I had scary dreams
I don't really wanna talk about it!
Well, that's too bad now, Nate
Shut up!
Now, where were we?
Well, back in the day when
You and I had it all mapped out in the basement
Crying in your room like a baby
""I wish mom was here!""
We all do so we wouldn't have to hear about it every single record
You don't really wanna change me
Yeah, I'm the one that made this happen
Do you really wanna get rid of your main attraction?
Let's pack our bags and go back to Gladwin now
Yeah, it's time for the third record
And you know I got the content
I don't wanna make you nervous
But it ain't like it used to be, we got a lotta people watchin' (Watchin')
You told me that you don't want me in your life, that's pretty hard to digest (Digest)
And I told you I'd leave when we die (Die), and we ain't died yet
Therapy Session was beautiful, Nate, but I'm wonderin' what's comin' next
Yeah, get that stupid hat off of your head when I'm talkin' to you, you hear what I said?
You don't like the prison I built you? (Built you)
Yeah, you wanna know what the funny thing is?
You keep on talkin' to me like a stranger
But we've been together since you were a kid (Kid), yeah
Took us from a no-name
Told you everything was okay
Now you tryna cut me out of it like I ain't never been a part of it
I am the heart of it, I made this whole thing
Yeah, I put us on the dope stage, you must have no brain
What's the point of havin' guns if you can't aim? (Can't aim)
What's the point of havin' blood with no veins? (With no veins)
What's the point of havin' love with no pain? (With no pain)
What I'm sayin' is me without you doesn't make any sense
I know I'm intense and controlling, but you need to learn how to cope with it
That's just the way that it is
If you didn't want me to live in your house, you shouldn't have let me move in
It's comfortable here and I like it, I got my own room and everything
It don't get better than this
You say you wanna own your life, then wake up and take your own advice
You're just mad 'cause you know I'm right
Yeah, I'm flattered you put me in Mansion, but you shoulda told 'em right
Held your hands on the coldest nights
You didn't tell 'em 'bout the times you and I used to hold the mic
I mean, what are you, outta your mind?
'Cause both of us will be, come on, let's go outside!
Is this what you wanted?
Both of us out in the open? Let's do it then!
I mean, why are you doin' this?
I know that you're mad (That you're mad), but I'm not in the mood for this
We got a record to drop (Drop)
So why you actin' like I'm not a part of it?
Aye, where is my shovel at?
Prolly out back where it always is
You can't get rid of all of me!
I'm the reason why—
Nah, shut up, I don't wanna hear another sentence
Hey, I'm NF
""Is it me or the fear talkin'?"" Ha! What a dumb question!
Yeah, it's real music 'til the day we die, right?
Yeah, ain't that the slogan, Nathan?
Thought I told you to keep your mouth shut
I mean, so what? You know I never listen
Let me guess, we gon' dig a hole, kill the track and prolly put a beat in it
Rap about it for like three minutes
Hey, that's pretty deep, isn't it?
Wait a minute, you don't really think for a second that you're puttin' me in this?
No, of course not, just a little deeper then we'll go inside and we can stop diggin'
Whew, you had me scared for a second, I thought we were diggin' my grave
*Thunk*
We did, what, you don't like bein' afraid?
Here's a dose of your own medicine
What, you don't like how it tastes?
My therapist told me don't bury my issues, but I'ma be honest, man, I'm feelin' great! (Great)
I think it's only right we go back to where you were created
I wrote a song for Johnny without you, but he ain't gon' like it, let's see how he takes it (Takes it)
He prolly don't even remember us, does he?
I wish I was burying anger
But both of us know I'ma need him for that song (That song), he still lives in the basement
Almost done, shoulda done this a year ago, I don't know why I waited
You know how I get, I put everything off in my personal life, you hear what I'm sayin'? (Sayin')
Ha, that was a joke (Joke), yeah, it's hilarious, ain't it?
You'll spend the rest of your life in my backyard or back of my mind—depends how you see it
Put the shovel away, time to go back in the house now, you'll be out in a week
Tellin' me you want your room back, that's funny; what? You ain't got nowhere to sleep?
I'ma just look out the window and laugh at you, this is crazy to me
'Cause I thought you had me in prison this whole time, but I'm the one holdin' the keys

Yeah, I got off stage like a month ago
I was talking to fans
And one of 'em pulled me aside and said
""We never met, but I swear that you know who I am
I've been through a lot
I don't know how to express it to people, don't think that I can
But I got that Mansion CD on rotation
That's real for me, Nate, you do not understand""
It's crazy for me
Kids hit me up, say they slittin' they wrists on the daily
This music is more than you think
Don't book me for just entertainment, it's entertainin'
Hearin' these parents, they telling their kids
My music is violent—you gotta be kidding me
I guess that your definition of violence and mine
Is something that we look at differently
How do you picture me, huh?
Want me to smile, you want me to laugh?
You want me to walk on the stage with a smile on my face
When I'm mad and put on a mask? For real though
I mean, what you expect from me?
I'm tryna do this respectfully
They say that life is a race
I knew my problems would prolly catch up eventually
I do my best to be calm
How you gon' write me and tell me you'd slaughter my family?
That's just a glimpse to the stuff that gets sent to me
These are the parts of my life they don't never see, woo!

Look
Self-awareness
Pride's a coat and yes, I like to wear it
Buttoned up, don't like to let no air in
With a pair of gloves that I hope doesn't perish
I discovered, though, when I get holes in them
And I let joy in, I'm in higher spirits
My mistakes are like a screamin' parrot
Just repeating lyrics, I can barely bear it
When I'm lost
Road is narrow
I'm lookin' down it like a gun's barrel
Aren't we all searchin' for the serum
That could help us breathe and leave our state of peril?
All of us have made defensive scarecrows
That we scatter 'round our fields and treat like heroes
When they scare away the things that we should cherish
'Cause we're too embarrassed to admit the fear is
That we're lost
Yeah, but what does it matter?
I get so combative, inside of me's a personal canvas
The paint can be splattered, get messy when I start to get rattled
The heart of a savage, I'm quiet when I lurk in the shadows
But somethin' don't add up, I don't wanna be overdramatic
But look at the data, it's obvious that humans are fragile
We tend to get mad at the ones that call us out but the fact is
We need someone that'll be honest when we fly off the handle
I admit I throw a fit when I begin to unravel
Keep my wits, been off the grid but now I'm back in the saddle
My intent is not to rent, I like to own what I value
I could sit here on the fence or maybe pick up the paddle
I like to row against the current, that's the way that I travel
Opposite of what the grain does, got the brain of a rebel
Take initiative, I'm diligent on every level
I never could settle, I like to keep my foot on the pedal, yeah
I'd love to pack arenas and all
But what I really wanna do is learn to handle my thoughts
And put the reins on 'em, show 'em I'm the one that's the boss
And pull 'em back when they get out of hand, I'm breakin' they jaws
I'm takin' the flaws, that told me I could never evolve
Then pull a Bane on 'em, ask 'em, ""Oh, you think you're in charge?""
You oughta know better, ain't no way around it, I'm flawed

You rappers ain't hungry like us

I'm in hip-hop's hospital bed, with a pad and a pen and a brace on my neck
They told me that I'm never leavin'
Why? I am as ill as it gets
Any rapper that say that they runnin' the game
I'ma come in they session and cut off they legs, woo!
Strap a grenade to my head, pull out the pin
My music is mind-blowin'
Ain't nobody do it like I do it
You ain't ever been on my level
I got a problem with the way they keep on talkin'
And actin' like everybody gonna get it
Better sleep with your eyes open
You wanna know what I noticed?
Look around at my fan base and they ready (I see you!)
That last album was heavy (I see you!)
That last album was gritty
How you gon' match that? Just let me
Do what I do best, you're better off playin' Russian roulette
Than comin' in a booth with me 'cause I get
A little bit intense, I'm like, ""Who's next?""
Y'all better watch it, take a look at where the clock is
It's my time
This ladder of music that I climbed
I took the machete, the game isn't ready
Them rappers, they comin' up on me
I cut off the ladder, and I told 'em, ""Bye-bye"" (Bye-bye)
What, you lookin' for a high-five? Nice try! (Woo!)
Do not believe everything that you read on the internet
I do not know who your dentist is
But he should clean out your mouth
Don't call me a sellout, that's something I've never been
I've been through hell all my life though
But I know what Heaven is
Father forgive me, for I am a sinner
But You gave me music as medicine, woo!
If nobody want a problem when they get in my zone, better leave me be!
I'm a mean MC
Better feed me rappers or feed me beats, agh!
Feed me both of 'em
They like, ""Nate, what's it like to be famous?"" (Hahahahahaha)
Umm, I'll let you know if I make it! (Yeah)
I wonder what life would be like
If I didn't stick out my neck
Two hundred dollars inside of my bank account, woo!
I was livin' on that
I need some money to pay for my rent
I need some money to pay for my gas
I'm not complainin', I'm just bein' honest
I promise that I will not beg for respect, nah!
I get so frustrated, take a look at what I've created
Time is wasting, and I ain't waiting
I'm a doctor with no job, me, I don't have no patience
I keep pacing, back and forth, I keep racing
You ain't never been in my book and I got a problem with it, why? 'Cause you actin' like you read my pages
I wreck these stages
Real talk, better give me space 'cause I am chasing
Something they told me that I won't make it, agh!
I'm not famous, I'm just Nathan (Woo!)
And I wonder how the world gon' take this
They might hate it
But you know anything about me
You know that don't mean I'm changin'
'Cause you know I'm real with it
Don't care if you feelin' it, I'm feelin' it
You don't like it? Then deal with it
And if God ain't real, real isn't
Used to wonder why I existed
I exist in the world that's real different
And, ""What you gon' be when you grow up, Nate?""
I doubt they will get it
My life is a mess, better watch your step when you step in it
Some of this brain is off-limits
I'm off in a world you don't get
'Cause you ain't ever been in it
In ten minutes I still couldn't explain what's inside my brain, don't mess with it
I've invested a lot of me inside these lines, I'm just protectin' 'em
Everybody wanna hear the real version of life
Then don't get so sensitive when I say something a little bit raw
I jot my thoughts and they call it negative

Forget the charts, I've been focusin' on holdin' my head up
Moment I get up, I just wanna know I'm doin' my best
And if I'm not, Lord forgive me, you can have the regrets
'Cause I can feel the water tryna go up over my head
Most of my life, I always felt like I was holdin' my breath
Holdin' my chest, to be honest, so I'm tired of it

All I know is I'll be doin' this
All I know is things are movin' quick
That's convenient for me 'cause that's how I live
Now they see me out here movin' up
You don't like me, that makes two of us
Time change, yeah, I can't adjust
Yo, it's who you are not who you was, oh my

I am way more than what people might think when they look on the surface

That is a question that I have been askin' myself and it hurts
'Cause it's prolly somethin' I should already know but I don't know it yet, I'm tryna grow as a person, woo
I'm sick of people tellin' people I'm here 'cause of marketin' dollars, oh
You think that everything is gonna blow just 'cause you market it harder? No
I got my hands in everything, now they out here tryna get to me, stop tryna lecture me
You don't compare to my level of thinkin', so why do you think you compare to my energy, huh?
Small circle, but the number's growin'
Fame called me, I'm like, ""How you doin'?""
Hung up on him, I ain't ready for it
I'll get back to that when I make album four
Less talkin', I've been workin' more
Better me is what I'm workin' towards
Y'all judgin', but we not in court, no, we not in court, oh Lord
Last couple years, let's recap
I make a livin' off of writin' out my regrets
I'm doin' me, I don't care where the scene's at
Try to give me feedback, I don't really need that
I used to walk on stage in a V-neck
I used to wear a lil' tie with a black vest
I came a long way, why you lookin' upset?
I'm tryna paint a picture, get the vision, you ain't hear it yet, woo
Look, hold up, hold up, wait a minute, please
Flow's switchin', I got ADD
Brain scatters when you play the beat
It don't matter what you say to me
I'll be doin' this at eighty-three
I've been doin' this since ABCs
In the major leagues doin' major things, don't play with me, woo
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Wake up every mornin thinkin' I'ma have a bad day
Drive my own car, I don't like the valet
Park then I go into my mind with an AK
Shoot every thought in my head then it rotates
Losin' it all, but I think that I'm okay
Who is involved? I don't know, but I'm insane
Poof, and I'm gone, wanna call me a no name, what?
I'm prolly not what you thought
I'm prolly not what you thought
I used to judge everybody that wasn't like me 'til I learned it was wrong
Girl told me I should get it together and get out the dark
I'm tryna give her my heart
That's when I sit in my car, writin' for hours until I can barely talk
I mean, where do I start? Feels like I'm fallin' apart
Act like my image is hard, I always put up my guard
Even when talkin' to God, sit in my room and I plot
Everything that I'm not, comes out in the music I jot
I give it all that I got, I give it all that I got
I'm tryna think out the box, no
Yeah, I got people standin' outside a bus screamin' my name
I don't come out and take pictures, they tell me I changed
I don't smile in VIPs, you get mad like, ""You know what I paid?""
Guess I don't know what to say
Guess I don't know what to say

I leave it all on the stage",NF|||NO NAME|||20,0,disappointment,annoyance,sadness,"[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.5173718929290771}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.2763083577156067}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.20794574916362762}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.0965404137969017}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.05450545251369476}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.052458375692367554}]"

Lookin' like I'm 'bout to set up a show in your kitchen
I'm out of my mind, but I feel like I'm in it

I'm still gonna kill it, you know what the deal is
Ain't never no chillin' when I'm in the buildin'
NF is a monster, I am a villain
My music is sick, and you don't know what ill is
You better get back, I don't write any filler
I write what I feel and I'm feelin' a million
So you better shh, be quiet, you hear it?
I'm 'bout to lose it
I'm on a whole different level of music
Don't treat me like I have no clue how to do this
You better rethink what you're thinkin' and move it
Now picture me writin' when I was a kid
Tryna make it in music, I think it is crazy
I spent all my money on studio time
Tryna get on my music so people could play it
I'ma keep it one hundred, my music was terrible
Learned to get better the more that I made it
Go back to my Moments album, most of you people
You prolly don't know what I'm sayin', hold up
What you're witnessin' now? Don't try to figure me out
I grab on that microphone, jawin' the crowd
They was laughin' at me, who they laughin' at now, huh?
I laugh at myself, some people they lookin' like, ""Wow
The moment you told me that you was a rapper
I couldn't believe it,"" you believe it now?
Step in the booth and I murder it
You never heard of a rapper that kill it like I do
I sleep on the couch in the studio
Stay up till three in the morning, and write till I get more
The moment I wake up I feel like I don't even sleep
And I'm ready to put out my record
Which, thank you for buyin', maybe you burned it
But either way, I'm gonna wreck it
I look at the industry, look what it did to me
You'll never make it if you never grind
You put a whole lot of money into it
You better be ready to give it your time
I look at the past awful years of my life
And I promise you I have been givin' it mine
Try to keep up with this, I'm not a puppet
No string on my back, I'm one of a kind
Music is changing, no way to tame this
I am an artist, look what I painted
Hang up the caution tape, I'm dangerous
Does anyone know where my brain is?
Rappers are comfortable knowin' they're famous
But I, really don't care what your name is
And I, really don't care if I'm nameless
Y'all just drivin' around, I know where my lane is
Cocky? Nah, I'm competitive
This is a job for me, it's adrenaline
Don't try to box me in, I am Mayweather
I come in the ring, my punches are way better
I never drink, but I live in these bars
The moment you blink is the moment you lost
Say you a king, who put you in charge?
Don't care what you think, I'll break in your car
Climb on the top of it, sound the alarm
And wake up the neighborhood, rap in your yard
And carry the speakers on both of my arms
Till you keep sleepin' on me, I'm at large
Enough with the jokes, I ain't jokin'
You come in a session with me, I'ma show you what dope is
And when I say dope, I ain't talkin' 'bout smokin'
I'm talkin' 'bout music that has an emotion
I look at this mic, it's part of my family
Take it away, I'm comin' to find you
I've been through a lot in my life
And it's hard to get people to listen when no one's behind you
And then Capitol came in the picture and gave me a shot
And look at it now
I look at the team I'm dealin' with, agh
These people ain't playin' around
Lookin' back, I gotta laugh
I was in a whole different place a year ago
I look at the math, I look at the map
And thank you God, I swear it's a miracle
And I'm sorry, but I gotta leave
But, man, this track was beautiful
The least I can do if I murder a beat
Is take the time to go to its funeral, haha",NF|||Intro|||21,0,amusement,annoyance,anger,"[{'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.3699685037136078}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.24605871737003326}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.1449143886566162}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.052287325263023376}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.0400397926568985}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.019376281648874283}]"

<Lyric> 
Woke up in a cell, where am I at?
Yeah, it's cold, but I like that
What am I, trapped?
Heart's beating out of my chest
Door's locked, but the keys are in my hands
Hmm, yeah, that's where it doesn't make sense, does it?
I make songs, I don't make friends, judge me
Might smile, but it ain't that funny
Sing along to the pain, they love it
Life's like a merry-go-round
And I'm still tryna figure it out
I like space, I don't fit in the crowds
My whole life I've been airin' it out
Oh, I'm gettin' into character now
Feels wrong, but it feels right
My feelings seal tight real nice
But I will fight anything to win
But I'm not Mike Tyson, I won't bite ya
But I will tell you if I don't like you
I am not the norm
I got my own shoes, I ain't tryna fit in yours
I never been married, but I've felt divorced
Hi, I'm Nate, have we met before?
Somebody told you I was wack? Check the source
Somebody told you I was back? Yes, of course
You got a problem with the fans? There's the door
You lookin' for the old me? Check the morgue, agh!
Not a fortune-teller, but I can see into the future better
Ain't no tellin' what'll happen when I pick up the microphone, get the fans together
Same style, but the songs are better
Been a year and a half, feels like it's gone forever
Ain't no drink in my hand, but you know the buzz is comin'
Big steps in the game, yeah, the Hulk is runnin'
My thoughts are funny, it feels like I'm onto somethin', yeah",NF|||Outcast|||22,0,amusement,love,curiosity,"[{'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.31338760256767273}, {'label': 'love', 'score': 0.21710820496082306}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.1923987865447998}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.12928059697151184}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.1218217983841896}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.08595970273017883}]"

Lights off in the room and I write songs
I might fall into my thoughts once in a while when the mic's off
You ain't ever seen no drive like mine, better hop outta my car
I'm about to unlock my doors
You ain't got a seat belt on, better find one
Gettin' sick of people tellin' me to smile more
T.S. was a chapter I'll never forget, it was therapy for me
But it's time to turn the page now

<Lyric> 
Yeah, sometimes I wanna disappear like I just don't exist
Or find a time machine and take me back when I was six
Maybe younger, either way, I guess the point of it
Would be to tell that little kid that he's gon' take a lotta hits
Yeah, I'd probably grab your hand and tell you life is hard
If you got questions or you need advice, then talk to God
'Cause He's the only one that listens even when you think He isn't
Even good people are great at makin' bad decisions, yeah (Oh)
They ain't gon' take it serious
You find out pretty quick that life is more than just appearances
I know some things we could avoid to save embarrassment
But everything that breaks you down can also build your character
'Cause people love to see you fail, just be aware of it
Don't let nobody tell you who to be or write your narrative
Look, we're all products of the things that we experience
But there's a big difference between confidence and arrogance
You hearin' this?
I know that you don't get it now, but you gon' get it later
I know you feel like you're alone and no one loves you maybe
And you gon' cover insecurities with lotsa anger
The weird thing is someday all of this will make you famous (Oh)
You start to write about your life and while they're all relatin'
You'll make up a slogan, call it ""Real,"" but feel like you're the fakest
Wish I could tell you that your future's nothin' but amazin'

My confidence about as low as the gas is
We didn't have the money for it, so we'd turn the key backwards and sit in parking lots for hours till the battery crashes
I think that we related 'cause both of us were lookin' for answers
A couple months ago I drove into Gladwin, got me all in my feelings
It's somethin' 'bout bein' somewhere that's familiar
Pull in the gas station, open up the tank then I fill it then laugh
Would I move back? Mm, not in a million, but I appreciate the memories we had

I know I've been distant, you know I never meant that
You can tell the family how I'm doing if they ask

<Lyric> 
Focus on it every single day, I wanna figure out a way
To get ahead of what I think I know is comin'
It's obvious you got a problem if you always tryna make it seem
As if you've never been afraid, then why you runnin'?
I could never look at what I do the way that other people can
And walk away, I can't be separated from it
Stickin' out my neck is how I made it where I'm at
You wanna cut it up but can't, man, they can never take it from me
(I'm) Outlandish, take chances
Gotta get it while I can with my damage
My sanity could leave but if it vanished
Don't matter to me, I'd still manage
Gue-guеss you could say I'm at an advantage
My vantage point can be quitе lavish
Got so many cadences, no way to pick
One, which bag is my hand in
Depends what mood I'm in
Oh, no, I'm in a mood again
Lord knows I'm a hooligan
Losin' it, who can get gruesome with
You if it comes down to it?
You can bet I shoot direct, defuse the threat
And they wonder why the music has a huge effect?
Could it be 'cause I've been the go-to when it comes to depth?
'Cause I'm the one that they be callin' when the people get fed up
And want the music with the visuals, I got a vendetta
For any part of me that wanna make it hard to get set up
But take away the happiness, it can be kinda pathetic
But when I look at everything that's tryna give me a headache
I gotta be honest, I really been the cause of it, get it
'Cause I can see a side of me you'll never see, you can tell
When I'm at the breakin' point, I finally had to sit with the devil
I went into hell and I asked him what the problem is, yellin'
He tried to get me to live with him, even called me a sinner
And told me everything about me doesn't feel like a winner
So why continue when he's tellin' me I might as well give up?
I took a moment, thought about it, feelin' caught in the middle
But got offended when he told me I would live in a kennel
And I can never leave it, even if I made it to Heaven
He'd find a way to get me back and send a demon to get me
I'm like, ""Woah (Woah), hold up, I don't think so""
Skin and bones meet my ego
How's he look? He don't eat much
Let him starve, I don't feed him
I just beat him, I just leave him in his womb, in the fetal
Let him cry, let him yell, let him scream, I don't need him
Lift off when I'm ticked off, my pitfalls I latch on to like a pit dog
I sit calm with a sick thought of a sitcom of the life I live
Life I live's more like a sci-fi flick
I hide in, wanna watch? Dive right in
My silence doesn't mean I'm dyin'
Just means I'm careful with the time I spend, so",NF|||TRUST|||27,0,disappointment,annoyance,disapproval,"[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4697434902191162}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.2668597996234894}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.16697938740253448}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.0679578110575676}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.06655216962099075}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.0618579126894474}]"

Or just close the curtains up and stay inside?

What is perfect? Not me
I've been overworkin' for weeks
I go home then purchase some things
That I know will not fill my needs
Have a dose of what I've achieved
Then get lonesome and I critique
Who I am and what I believe
Make up standards too high to reach
Untrained animal off the leash
I'm in panic, but yet relieved
Brought your hammock to hang with me?
Grab a hatchet, cut down your tree
Like a mannequin that can speak
What I have in store is unique
I just mop the floors with MCs
I can't stop until things are clean
I'm an amateur's what you think
So you stand there in disbelief
'Til I dislocate both your feet
That's what happens, you step to me
Not too graphic, but not PG
Lots of action in every scene
I'm kidnapping all of your dreams
Hold 'em hostage and watch 'em scream (Ahh!)
Rap aside, I am what I advertise
Don't matter how you put it, we live, then we have to die
You might hate it, but you can't deny
See, everything that I've been doing got me lookin' like a mastermind
It's so vain, but I vandalize that I do what you fantasizin'
Took a vision of my dreams
And then found a better way that I can make it
I've been looking, think I'm really 'bout to maximize it (Agh!)
These bullets form in my mind and come out my mouth and (Pow, pow, pow)
For anyone out there doubting or acting mouthy (Watch, watch, watch)
Forget what you heard about me, I've been astounding (Got, got, got)
Something for you thinking you might run circles 'round me
Yeah, ain't this all I ever wanted?
That's a fact, no, that's a lie, no
I'm confused, yeah, I got problems
What's the use? Yeah, let's be honest
Screws are loose, I need 'em tightened
Not amused, yeah, look what I did
Brought you something, hope you like it
So precise, the flow the nicest
So productive, stop your whining
Back in style like I was vinyl
I make songs and they go viral
Something's off if I go idle
""Been so long,"" yeah, okay, I know
Take your shoes off, you're in my home
You got fans, but not like I do, yeah (I do, I do)
Thankful, I try to be, can't contain what's inside of me
They don't like this side of me 'cause I lack in compliancy
I question what I can see if you're not playing my CD
No expiring, I'll decide when I think it's my time to leave (Woo)
Yeah, 'cause they won't retire me, it inspires me to be inspiring
When I'm low I feel like I'm spiraling
Pushin' forward, look, I can't ignore it
There ain't no I in team, but drop the T and A
Sometimes, if I'm bein' honest, feels like it's only me
No defeat, notably, better have it right if you're quoting me
Write my name on your hit list, it might be the last time you wrote something
Rip that cocky smile right off your face for thinking you're close to me
Grab a can of gasoline, light it all over your self-esteem
Selfishly watching y'all helplessly pretend you're on my planet
Shoot you out of the sky like you're punchlines, you are not landin'
Gun jammin', reach in your mouth and rip out your tongue after tongue
Lashings, I hand 'em out like pamphlets in church, Pastor
Show up to my funeral wearin' all black, and what's happenin'?
I look around and wonder, ""Where my fans at?""
Oh Lord, they know me so well, they know I'm not in that casket
Trash bag is prolly buried somewhere full of my ashes
My music's superb, playin' with words, play with my nerves
They gon' have a list of issues long as my shirts
Very absurd, very disturbed
Stare at the Earth like, ""This is not the place I was birthed""
I'm generic, you sure?
Oh, they think I'm very reserved
'Til I open up on the beat like on my Therapy work
I don't care what you heard, real scary, carry the verse
While I'm wearin' my merch, stompin' on your arrogant turf
Sit back and observe, nah, I like to actually work
This life's so unpredictable, it just keeps pitching me curves
I take a swing, I hate the things that make me feel like I'm dirt
I've patiently been waitin', please, I think it's time for my turn
My expertise are melodies, they talk to me when I'm hurt
Just let me be, eventually someday they'll see what I'm worth
I cross my I's and dot my T's, it makes no sense, but I've learned
Normal to you is not to me, the outcast finally returns (Returns, returns)",NF|||Returns|||32,0,confusion,approval,annoyance,"[{'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.627360999584198}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.17610955238342285}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.15351256728172302}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.08565313369035721}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.05862376093864441}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.05197795480489731}]"

Wasn't so caught up in all of the small things
Wasn't so adamant that I could handle everything alone

And actually listened to things that my heart said, heart said
Ridin' my bike, just ridin' my bike
Not overthinkin' my life
Not always wonderin' if I'm a likable person
Or someone that nobody likes
Not always stressed about money or losin' my job
Or scared I ain't makin' a flight
Not always goin' to bed every night
With this knot in my stomach that never unwinds
What happened to me? Yeah, what happened to me?
When did I start to believe I wasn't worth it
Then question my purpose to breathe?
Wonderin' who I should be
Happiness out of my reach
Scared to get back on my feet
Need to get rid of what's detrimental, but it's hard to let go
When the thing that hurts you help you get to your dreams
See, I miss the days when I wasn't so faded
Love wasn't always invasive, I could embrace it
Just innocent, waitin', not always livin' in anguish
When did I break and become overtaken?
What was the moment I caved and
Gave away all of my faith and made a replacement?

Talk to you with my hands tied
Walk towards you on a fine line
Everybody has a dark side
I feel embarrassed when they see mine
Rain falling from my dark skies
Clouds parting, but it's all lies
Shouldn't I see the sunshine now?
Wonder how I look in God's eyes
Am I a good person or a lost one?
Will this feel worth it when I'm all done?
Will I feel ashamed or like who I was?
Will the pain vanish or will more come?
Will I stay numb or regain love?
Maybe someday have a taste of freedom?
Will I take the poison out of my blood?
Or just leave it there inside of my lungs?
I know (Know, know)
I should let you go, hands are feeling cold
Just leave me alone (No, no, no)
I just want control, I feel so exposed
Liars in my home (No, no, no)
Please do not provoke, noose around my soul, I cut down a rope
They don't want me happy, they don't want me fixed
They don't want me better, they just want me broke
Talk but never listen, at least I admit it
Block out all my vision, watchin' me diminish
That's my favorite pastime, I know nothing different
Tell me something different, I don't see the difference
I just feel offended, I just feel defensive
Why don't you accept me? I just need acceptance
Time is of the essence, don't like how we spend it

Look, I don't know what's gotten into me
I could be off of my rocker potentially
Bigger I get, the more they thinkin' less of me
Don't be the one to insult my integrity
Put down the whistle, I'm done with you referees
Y'all don't know nothing, you think you ejected me
'Til I show up in the game, like, ""Remember me?""
I gotta make it, these people depend on me
Ayy, that's how I'm living these days
Threaten my wife, keep digging that grave
I had a job making minimum wage
Told myself that I gotta get paid
Prove myself, yeah, get up my grades
Walk into class like, ""Gimme that A""
Think I'm trash? Put a bag in your face
And I put you by the road like, ""Look, we're the same!""
Here's a reminder that I still spit
Think I need to advise you to watch your lip
Or at least realize that I'm not no kid
Don't Google my name tryna find my crib
Write a pop song, then I write a song like this
Do a lot wrong? Doesn't matter, I learn quick
I'm an outlaw, my brain has no fence
Doesn't matter either way to me 'cause even if it did
I would destroy it (Woo, woo, woo)
Used to be employee, now I'm employer
Making big deals, now I gotta get lawyers
People tell me to relax and enjoy it
But when I kick back, I see warnings
So much time might pass, can't ignore it
Every time I rap and I'm recording
Might be my last so I absorb it 'cause",NF|||Options|||38,0,annoyance,anger,realization,"[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.35597237944602966}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.3155052363872528}, {'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.055234361439943314}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.05490434914827347}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.04853691905736923}, {'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.044551193714141846}]"

All I ever wanted was somebody to hear me
And all I ever wanted was somebody to feel me
And everybody wanna tell me that I'm out of my head
When I'm on the mic, that's fine, but that don't scare me
It's been a long time, but I'm back now
Rap pow, welcome to the rap house
Rap pow, will live 'til I pass out
Blackout, blackout, everybody keep on wonderin' if I still rap now
Are you serious?
Anybody out there hearin' this?
Yo, I came in the game as a lyricist
And I'ma leave like that, period
You sniff lines, I write lines
You've now entered in my mind
And you better get ready 'cause you might find
I'm from a different place, and my kind
It's a little bit different than yours is
Quit snoring, hip-hop isn't dead
It's just been in mournin'
From the moment I quit recording
Quick, record this
Listen, I'm warming up and you're misinformed if
You think that I'm slipping up, this ain't sick enough
Then I'll skip the chorus
I've been here, ain't nobody heard of me?
Yeah I'ma turn this beat to a murder scene
I don't live for the world
I live for the King, I live for the King, focus
Wrote this with emotion
It's hard to get a break when the doors ain't open
It's hard to get a shot when the gun ain't loaded
And it's hard to make a living when nobody wanna notice, hold it
What am I insane maybe? Plain crazy
You put me in a room with a mic you will not restrain me
You do what you wanna but you can't contain me, lazy
Is not a character trait of mine, don't wait in line

All I ever wanted was somebody to play this
Yeah, take my song, put it on their playlist
And get goosebumps every time they play it, rate us
If that's my calling or not, Father, maybe I should just not bother
Go back to that nine-to-five, but I am not a quitter so quit that
I never been a killer but I guarantee I kill tracks
Put them in a coffin, lost in, rip that
Tryin' to make an impact in rap, is that insane?

Rap though, better give me that pencil
And you ain't ever gonna make it, it's all mental
I am in a place where I can't let go, agh!
I still work a job and do this, and y'all know what's stupid?
I thought all you had to do was get a record deal, and, your things start moving
But that's not the case, because most of the times—the artists you hear
You keep on thinking that artist is new, but that artist has prolly been at it for years
Yeah, in the back of my mind thinking, am I wasting my time dreamin'?
And I ain't got no money in my wallet, but I guarantee there ain't no way that I am gonna leave this
I need this, I swear to y'all, I need this
And this hip-hop's in my veins, if you cut me I'ma bleed it
And, yo, what you think I write raps for? No reason? No
Take my pain and I put 'em in a song—ever since them pills, they took my mom
I've been a different person, don't try to predict my verses
What you're hearing now is me whether I'm in front or behind that curtain
I stand behind these words and, I'm a Christian but I'm not perfect

<Lyric> 
Woke up in a bad place
Should probably get up, so I'm not late
Stared at my phone for the past eight
Minutes at nothin', my head aches
Bottles empty by the lampshade
I'm out of Excedrin again, great
Too early to tell, but at this rate
I'm thinkin' this might be a bad day
I walk out the bedroom, my roommate's
Asleep on the couch with her two-faced
Boyfriend who lives here, but don't pay
A penny for rent, but he still stays
She says he's broke, I'm like, ""No way""
Probably sells drugs, but she won't say
Told me he dabbles in real estate
I mean I don't believe it, but okay
Okay, pull out the driveway
Notice my gas tank's on E again, well, of course, it is
Guess I probably should stop at the gas station
So I take a right, pull up to the pump
While it's pumpin', I look at my ashtray
Then remember I need to get cigarettes (Cigarettes)
Anything to help my mind state
So, I park and walk inside—wait!
I should probably get somethin' to drink and eat, I guess
So I find and grab a couple bags of chips
Where's the candy aisle? Oh, yeah, here it is
Which one should I get? Should I grab the Starburst or
Change it up and maybe grab the Twix?
Mm, grab the Starburst, then I started walkin'
As I pass the garbage and I reach the fridge
I hear someone yellin' at the front of the store
Probably just a homeless guy getting bored
Probably just a customer whose card
Didn't work, and now he wants to start a war
Man, I can't afford to
Keep buyin' energy drinks everyday, I shut the door, then
Turn around and as I'm headin' towards the counter
With my drink, I hear, ""Hey, open up the drawer!""
Crouching on the floor
Peek around the aisle, gun is on the fore-
Head of the man that's behind the counter
Now my heart is poundin' and I'm prayin' to the Lord
I don't die today, I can't die today
I got things to do, tryin' not to shake
Plotting my escape, where's my cellphone at?
Left it in my car, icing on the cake
I start crawling, I can hear 'em yellin'
""I want every penny, I want every dime!"" (Yeah)
""Once you finish with the cash
Open up the bag, throw some cigarettes inside"" (Yeah)
""Which ones do you want? Which ones do you want?""
""I'm not picky, give me any kind
Give me all of 'em, yeah, just toss 'em in
Keep it movin' though, I'm runnin' low on time and
I'd advise ya to move a little quicker
Trust me, I don't wanna have to pull the trigger
I've done it before, it's not a pretty picture
What, you don't believe me? I'm just playin' with ya
Well, no I'm not, no I'm not
Just do what I say 'cause if you even think of tryna pull a fast one on me
Promise you'll be sorry
Oh, my driver's calling, I can't miss my pick-up""
That's when I did somethin' stupid
And my jacket knocked over a can of soup and then
It got quiet, did he hear me movin'? Shh!
Hold my breath, he must've heard me do it, huh?
I'm assumin' the
Noise must've made him turn his head enough
To let the guy that was at gunpoint grab his own gun
Now they both got weapons
Maybe I should help him
Sneak up slow and deck him
Time to go, time to go, time to go
It's gon' be a bloody miracle
Now or never, God, if I had any blessings
Comin' in my future, could You send 'em to my present?
Peek around the edge, and I start runnin' at him
He don't see me comin', does he? Steppin' closer
Grab his neck and hold him, squeezin' on his throat
I'm tryna choke him, then his elbow hits my nose and
Think he broke it, I think he broke it, my
Blood is leakin' all over my clothes, I try
Not to let go, but my hands begin to slip and bullets start to fly
(*gunshots*) Can't see out my eyes
(*gunshot*) Cashier still alive?
I can't tell, I'm tryna crawl away, here comes another guy
He runs inside, like, ""Where's the money?
Did you get the money? Where's the bag you brought?"" (Ayy)
""I don't know, I think it's still behind the counter
Prolly by the cashier I just shot"" (Ayy)
""Who's this on the floor? Who's this on the floor?
""I don't know!"" ""Well, did they call the cops?""
He runs up to me, then he grabs my shoulder
As he flips me over, then my jaw drops, 'cause
I thought his voice sounded real familiar, he's
Got a mask on, but the shirt he's wearing
Is the same one he had on this morning
Staring in my eyes, I know he knows I know
Embarrassed, he stands above me and says, ""Sorry Erin, but
I don't have a choice,"" he holds the barrel up
To my head, I scream, ""You can't be serious!""
He shakes his head and says, ""I'm sorry,"" then the gun— (*gunshot*)",NF|||STORY|||43,0,disappointment,sadness,realization,"[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.35818132758140564}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.321926474571228}, {'label': 'sadness', 'score': 0.10030364245176315}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.04244223237037659}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.03787825629115105}, {'label': 'disapproval', 'score': 0.03704255074262619}]"

<Lyric> 
I'm dedicated, the definition of dedication
Wrote this whole record while I was levitating
Sittin' in my room with the pen and paper, I'm innovative
They've been afraid of me since I was a second grader
I'm the kid on the playground mama told you to never play with
There's levels of music—and I'm in the elevator
Going up to the top floor, look how we elevated
What, you don't know the brand by now? You better get educated
Take both of my arms, rip 'em out the sockets and separate 'em
Forgive me, yeah, I know I get animated
Don't matter, I still write a better record than yours without a hesitation
Never been more motivated
Just look at all the minds I have opened and penetrated
See, I am the voice of all these kids that think things, but never say 'em
That's why they come to my shows wearing the NF hoodies and hats low like we're carrying weapons, ah!
Put the controllers away, it's game over
I promise I'm way colder
The fans keep saying that they're hungry for new music
Well that's pretty convenient 'cause I just made a plate for 'em
And I don't hear what none of y'all are saying
I just sit at the keys feeling the music
Got me thinking I'm Beethoven
The game needs a makeover
If you've been waiting, the wait's over
You ain't notice, y'all about to witness a takeover, I'm home!
Yeah, they waiting on me to match the
Emotion that I had in the last one
What if I don't, they gon' tell me that I'm losing my passion?
If I do, am I repeating my actions?
Yeah, look, ""How Could You Leave Us"" is massive
There ain't nothing I can write that'll match that
My biggest fear writing this record wasn't putting out trash
It was disappointing myself and the fanbase
Now I want you to picture me:
I'm in a hotel rapping, crying on the floor of the bathroom
Staring in the mirror, my room, hands shaking playing ""How Could You Leave Us"" through the speakers on my iPhone
Tryna figure out if I'ma always feel the way that I feel or maybe someday I can learn to be happy
Or maybe I can't be, 'cause if the music ain't emotional enough, are they gon' call me a has-been?
Pain's always been the root of my music
If I cut it off, how am I supposed to keep growing
If I let it go, won't my whole career be in ruins?
That's when I realized this whole conversation is stupid
I never cared to impress people that don't even know me
I just write what I feel, somehow it started a movement
Trying to enjoy a career, but I don't know how to do it
When I spend all of my time being afraid I'ma lose it!
But, then I figured out the reason they follow me
The reason why these fans surrounding me
It's not 'cause I'm a ""Rap God""
I don't need you people to bow to me
All they ever did was doubt on me, now everyone's proud of me
Acknowledge me or not, you ain't ignoring the following
I'm just teaching 'em something they couldn't learn in they colleges
This is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives, feels like it's darker than Halloween!
Yeah, you ain't alone out there, look around you—we got a lot of fans in here
Couple hundred thousand, that's what we did last year
Listen to Intro III, trying to kill my fear
They'll get that in a minute
We about to shatter the critics
I am a savage, admit it
A lot of baggage I live in
That's why the passion is different
Really don't care if they get it
We're only three records in it and this is just the beginning
I'm home!",NF|||Outro|||46,0,disappointment,fear,nervousness,"[{'label': 'disappointment', 'score': 0.26078858971595764}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.20966550707817078}, {'label': 'fear', 'score': 0.20420029759407043}, {'label': 'nervousness', 'score': 0.09039296209812164}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.06677955389022827}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.05309176817536354}]"

Yeah (Haha)
My name buzzin', ain't no way you could ignore it
I did not come this far so they could ignore me
I am not the one to say, ""I'll do it in the mornin'""
I'd rather get it done, don't focus on what's not important
They try to talk to me like they been nothin' but supportive
Appreciate the love, but do not show up on my doorstep
If you ain't about that real, I suggest that you avoid me
If we ain't on the same page, that's the end of story, agh!
You are not a baller 'cause your closet's full of Jordan's
You are not a rich man 'cause you're on the Forbes list
First, I drop the record, then you know I gotta tour it
Real's still the slogan, only difference is there's more of us
The story of my life feels like it's just beginnin' now
I ask you a question, I want answers, not the run-around
You the one that brought it up, but I'm the one to shut it down
If you ain't got the album yet, I brought you one, I'm at your house

And pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine
But you feel like even though you got everything in the world
You got nothing
So what you do then is you start going backwards
You runnin' in a direction
And you lookin' for something that isn't real
And all you know is that you just gotta have it
What you're doin' is sleepin'
And thinking that you're awake and you're not
And the problem is that you don't know what you're after
So you put everything that you have into what you do
Hoping that one day maybe you don't have to feel like you're empty
But as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy

And you feelin' like you ain't got a purpose
And you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess
Like you ain't nothing but worthless
And, yo, you look around
A lot of these other people you lookin' at
To you, you describe as perfect
So you point a finger at God and tell Him to do His job
And fix ya life up 'cause nothin' is workin'!
And you will try to hide it and make it seem like it's nothin'
But really you feel like everything is crashin' around you
And you developed a problem in trusting in other people
Which later became an issue that would mentally pound you!
You only get one life
But every time you lookin' at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes
And the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life
Is because you were never awake!

<Lyric> 
(Yeah!) I'm back, did anyone miss me?
They said the second record can be tricky
Well, that's kind of funny, 'cause I am not trippin'
My fans—they know what it is and they with me
Yeah, I ain't the type that's gon' ride with the semi
I came from a town with three lights and no city
I've been doing shows for nothin' but pennies
When I leave the stage, they never forget me
Mansion was a glimpse of my life
I let you see what it's like to be in my head
People ask me what I think I think I'd be doin'
If it wasn't music, I'd rather be dead, agh!
You heard what I said, that was like me at a three
You don't wanna see me at ten
Or maybe you do
I promise if that is the case, then that is what y'all gonna get
If you're looking for music with watered down lyrics
I promise that you need to go somewhere else
And if you want somebody to tell you everything
That you wanna hear, I won't be any help
This flow is familiar, I think I heard it before
Yeah, I made it myself!
I left the door open to come in my mansion
But I never said it's a beautiful house
Some of y'all sat on the porch
Looked at my windows and stared at my door
They ask me if I'm gonna kill it this record
I laugh in their face and I ask 'em, ""Do you see the blood on the floors?""
""He's at it again""
""NF is crazy, he's bad for the kids""
""He never talks about nothing but him""
""And my friends say, 'He's kind of a diva.'""
Well, you need to get some new friends
I'm as chill as it gets
'Til I get on the stage and flip on the switch
And I go to a place where nobody is
If you bring up my name in a song, that's something that you will regret
Learned a lot in a year
I remember the shows when no one was there
I remember the shows when nobody cared
Some people in front of me laughing like, ""He isn't going nowhere.""
It's funny now, isn't it?
This type of life isn't how I envisioned it
This type of life, it just ain't how I pictured it
I'm in the back of the tour bus
Tryin' to FaceTime my family, it's different
Not what you think it is
Write a review, tell me what you think of this
Give me three stars and call me an idiot
But to be honest, it don't make a difference
I know some people don't get it
But you have now entered a therapy session
If you don't like music that's personal
I have no clue what you people are doin' here, might as well throw out the record
I pull up a chair, I talk to my music like nobody's there
Only person I judge is the one in the mirror
And lately, he ain't doin' well
I don't need y'all in my ear
I'm tired of hearin' it
You call it music, I call her my therapist
She keep on telling me I have been carryin'
Way too much baggage, I need to take care of it
I know she's right, but, man, it's embarrassing
Music has raised me more than my parent did
Take out a picture of us and I stare at it
Who am I kiddin'? You probably ain't hearin' this
Show me an artist you wanna compare me with
You put us both on a track, I'ma bury 'em
Give me the shovel, it's 'bout to get scarier
None of you want it with rap, who you staring at?
I see you got beats, but where is the lyrics at?
NF is the logo, you know I've been wearin' that
Don't come to my show and be sittin' that very back
I call you out in the crowd like, ""There he is!""
Thought I'd be happy, it feels like I'm cursed
It's hard to be clean when you play in the dirt
You gave me this place to go when I'm hurtin'
I thought it'd get better, but it's getting worse
And I got nobody to blame when I work
Like 24/7, I ain't been to church
And Satan keep callin' me, he tryna flirt
I hang up the phone, these are more than just words
I drive on that highway and listen to Mansion
I look up to God like, ""When did this happen?""
Yellin' with all of my fans to wake up
But feel like I haven't
I get emotional, I didn't plan this
I'm doing things I never imagined
I'm sorry, but I gotta leave
I don't wanna be late for my therapy session, agh!",NF|||Intro 2|||53,0,amusement,joy,approval,"[{'label': 'amusement', 'score': 0.8333657383918762}, {'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.1784115433692932}, {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.10887718200683594}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.0444122813642025}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.033293455839157104}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.028780827298760414}]"

Tossin' what you want aside for longevity, ain't meant to be
If it causes everything to collapse and affects your heart heavily
What's worth it and what's not?
What's certain and which side would the coin flip to and land on?
When you guess wrong, do you stand up or stand down?
Even with a man down, I man up
Well-rounded, held out for the right outlet
Nine houses couldn't make me feel home, childish
Me left, see, the outcome every ounce of my childhood
Played a role in how I wound up with an outlook so crowded
No knowledge, couldn't see through the piles of my problems
Still piled up, past tense, man, I wish it was, but I've come
So far so quickly
In it for the long haul, it's routine
Only thing I'm cool with losing is losing sleep
And it's only cool with me
If it means I get to watch my dreams
Come true, if I kept it brief
Still you think it was a long story
Recording half of the things I think would
Take six years, prepare, 'cause the chance that you asked for
Might show up at your door one night like, ""I'm here
Gonna let me in or just stare?""
It's clear, yeah, six ain't enough
That wouldn't come close to the content between my ears

Get inside of rooms with the biggest of names
Hire fifty people just to give me advice

Wouldn't work? But worked out, havin' cold feet

I left my girl there, wish I would've done it different

I told her I would change a million times and never did it

You never felt love and I always felt disrespected
Your family thought I was a joke, I was always defensive
They just wanted what was best for you, I just couldn't accept it
And hurting you was not a part of my plan or my intentions
But I was immature, I guess I had to learn some lessons
We grew apart and our lives went in different directions
And there's a lot of responsibilities that I neglected
I had a lot that was bottled inside, couldn't express it
And this pain won't leave, I can feel the depression
It's taking over my body, feels like I'm always stressing
Doctor told me I should sleep, but I'm always restless
I lay awake at night and think, my thoughts are relentless
I need a moment to breathe, I need a moment to vent this

Please don't bring up my issues unless you gon' deal with your own
Please don't try to pretend like you keep it real, though
Yeah, it's funny that you got a lotta money
But that money doesn't buy you skills, though

On a killin' spree, I'm 'bout to kill more
Got a chain on you paid a mill' for (Woo)
I mean what you people even live for?
I write raps, you steal yours, oh Lord (Haha)
We just gettin' warmed up (Woo)
Yeah, I said I was comin', I warned you (Ah)
So close to the fans, I feel like they ride on my tour bus
You wanna know what I do in my downtime? They come to my fortress
I apologize for all the corpses
It's a mess right now, but I haven't had time to put the rappers in the coffins (Yeah)
We ain't talked in like six years, why you writin' me now?
I just turned a 100K down, just to keep the brand lookin' right, now (That's real)
I ain't braggin' 'bout the money, I'm just sayin' I ain't controlled by the bank account

'Bout to hit the West Coast, hype crowds

Nah, I've been lookin' for a beat, look what I found, woo
I mean everything is comin' out of my mouth
Tried to tell me, yeah, I ain't had the right sound
Oh yeah? Well, tell me what you think now
Two records in the bag, I ain't done, no
What's comin' next year? Let me hear the drum roll
Don't flow, anybody wanna be the one
To make an issue out of nothin'? I'ma hit you with my iPhone
I know, I'm a little out of hand now
I ain't lookin' for a handout
You ain't like what I was doin' last year which is funny
'Cause you lookin' like a fan now, are you a fan now?
I kinda miss bein' broke, now let me go back to my old days
When I used to walk into high school and hand out my CD in hallways
I told all my teachers that I'd be a rapper, they smiled and looked at me, ""Okay
That's a pretty nice dream, but you better get a real job."" Mmm, no way
Yeah, I live what you dreamin' (Oh)
I could do this while I'm sleepin'
I ain't the type that'll bring up your name for nothin'
But please, don't give me a reason
I'm on the edge now, I ain't playin' with you
Never really been a fan of takin' pictures
I'm just bein' honest, yeah, I'll take it with you
Shows sellin' out, better get your tickets, oh Lord
I got a love for the fans
I can't express what it feels like (Oh yeah)
Sometimes I wonder if it's even real life
Sometimes I look at the past and think about how I got here in the first place
You know the glove is my birthplace
I don't wanna be rude, but I could get you on my worst days
Say nothin' for me, do it all the time
Yeah, they barely workin' while I'm workin' overtime
Last year they like, ""Who am I?""
Now this year they like, ""You the guy""
Here's a lil' some' for your car rides
If they said I fell off, they all lied
Yeah, you know the logo, better recognize
Yeah, it's Real Music 'til the day we die, yeah

Bury the real you so deep that you can't even find yourself

One minute I'm on the ground, next minute I'm in the sky
I feel invincible, and so unrejected
Forget it, I'm invisible, and I feel unprotected
Yo, I don't need nobody else, trust me, I'm fine
I can't do this by myself, I'm losing my mind
Yeah, I can see clearly, forget it, I'm blind
My heart says, ""danger,"" can't you read the signs?
Yo, but through all the pain, I swear I love it
No matter what you do, it don't disappear, does it?
Yo, I'd rather spend a minute with love in my life
Than go a million years without knowing what it's like
You better grab it, you don't wanna lose it
And yeah, it brings pain, it's insane, but the bruises
My God can take that all away, you'll find that right person
And everything you thought that wasn't becomes worth it

I'm boss with it, authentic, all y'all frauds better
Quit with the trash talk before you get tossed in it
Y'all tripping, bar ripping, y'all sipping too much, write 'till the palms dripping
Lost in it, thoughts different, you don't want no drama? Then don't get involved in it
I'm in a whole different head space, you making money? Well that's great
I got no interest in talking to people that I know are two-faced, too fake, get outta my face, woo!
What are you doing in my lane? There's already too many rappers
I'm sick of the traffic and I ain't got no brakes
I already passed you, you don’t like what I’m doing, who asked you?
You got into music 'cause you think it’s fun, man I’m doing this 'cause I have to
It’s real music, chills to it, feel through it, real stupid
Skills truest, quit moving, woo!
If I say something, I will do it, yeah
I used to dream of these moments
I'm living 'em now
Look up to heaven like, ""Mom, are you proud?""
I'm on the way to New Zealand, I'm up in the clouds, dang
I mean who woulda known this, who woulda known this
This industry never told me I was welcome
I went to the house with a bat and I broke in
Then told 'em that I would be back
I flatline, all of your whack rhymes, that's mine
Might get away from it, boy, MM LP—I'm the bad guy, last time
I have been taking it easy, the game's mine, fame why?
I don't care about none of that, I'm just sick of the trash lines
I grew up on Eminem, now look where the game's at
Lame raps, Hollywood fame acts, I'm sick of the same trash
I got no blunt in my mouth but give me a beat, I'ma blaze that, woo!
Give me a beat, I'ma blaze that, you and me ain't in the same class
You and me ain't on the same row, music has always been my home
I used to call up some people that won't call me back, now they blowing up my phone, woo!
Ain't it funny how that works? Mad perks, killing the record
Got blood on my black shirt, I'm jealous in love with the music, don't ever come near her!
I ain't from around here, how you let me run it down here?
If that isn't bothering none of you rappers then what are y'all doing out here?
That was like music to my ears, might never make it, I don't care
Drake, I love what you doing, but call up the game and tell 'em that I'm here, yeah!
I like that, might snap, I laugh, y'all better surrender and get out your white flags
And cancel your flight plans, your career isn't taking off
You sound like a hype man hit you with the mic stand
And they ask what the hype's about, come and find out, I mean, where are you clowns at?
I been training, pen game is insane, I'm done playing
This music is ground breaking, lung shaking, done waiting
Y'all taking my patience, quit faking, y'all hating, it's crazy!

Lifе when I was on empty, and I was goin' crazy
Stood by my side, it's only right that I return the favor

Been to hell and back ever since that first EP came out with ""All I
Have"" on it, I've been givin' all I have
Wasn't really prepared for the pain, I was
Gonna have to go through to get to the
End result that I knew I wanted
Hoped I would make an impact in rap
Has that been insane? Yes, but it
Was worth it, I can't imagine
If I woulda gave up and just turned my back on this
Music, where would I be now?
Don't know how I woulda made it out from
Underneath that rainy cloud
Had my doubts, yes, but that's how I found my
True purpose, if my surface looks great
Who cares if underneath I'm hurtin'?

Feels like I'm in the sky
Flying over clouds or somethin'
I don't smoke weed, but you could say I'm high on somethin'
Its like this music is my addiction, I call it my nicotine
What you're witnessing is an addicted fiend and it sickens me (AH)
Just a lame as how you picture me
Give me that microphone and I'm gonna rip it so viciously

Ain't it ironic I brought up chemistry?

<Lyric> 
""Hey, Nate, how's life?""
I don't know, it's alright
I've been dealin' with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night
""I'm sorry,"" that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny's goin' on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out
I've been searchin'
""What does that mean, Nate?"" I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin' my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it?
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm saying, and—
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean off my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great—not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith (Woo)
I've been developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me ""Tone that down,"" but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist

<Lyric> 
Alles, was ich je wollte, war jemand, der mich hört
Und alles, was ich je wollte, war jemand, der mich fühlt
Und jeder will mir sagen, dass ich nicht ganz richtig im Kopf bin
Wenn ich am Mikrofon bin, das ist in Ordnung, aber das macht mir keine Angst
Es ist lange her, aber jetzt bin ich wieder da
Rap-Pow, willkommen im Rap Haus
Rap-Pow, ich lebe, bis ich ohnmächtig werde
Blackout, blackout, alle fragen sich, ob ich jetzt noch rappe
Ist das dein Ernst?
Hört das irgendjemand da draußen?
Yo, ich kam in das Spiel als Lyriker
Und so werde ich auch wieder gehen, Punkt
Du ziehst lines, ich schreibe sie
Du bist jetzt in meinem Kopf angekommen
Und du machst dich besser bereit, denn du könntest feststellen
Dass ich von einem anderen Ort komme, und meine Art
Ist ein bisschen anders als deine
Hör auf zu schnarchen, Hip-Hop ist nicht tot
Er hat nur getrauert
Seit ich mit dem Aufnehmen aufgehört habe
Schnell, nimm das auf
Hör zu, ich wärme mich auf und du bist falsch informiert, wenn
Du denkst, dass ich einen Fehler mache, das ist nicht krank genug
Dann überspringe ich den Refrain
Ich war hier, hat niemand von mir gehört?
Ja, ich verwandle diesen Beat in einen Mordschauplatz
Ich lebe nicht für die Welt
Ich lebe für den König, ich lebe für den König, Fokus
Ich schrieb das mit Emotion
Es ist schwer, eine Chance zu bekommen, wenn die Türen nicht offen sind
Es ist schwer, einen Schuss zu landen, wenn die Waffe nicht geladen ist
Und es ist schwer, seinen Lebensunterhalt zu verdienen, wenn niemand es bemerkt, halte es
Bin ich vielleicht wahnsinnig? Völlig verrückt
Steckt man mich in einen Raum mit einem Mikrofon, kann man mich nicht zurückhalten
Ihr könnt tun was ihr wollte, aber ihr könnt mich nicht bändigen, faul
Ist keine Charaktereigenschaft von mir, warte nicht in der Schlange
Das ist der aktuelle Zustand meines  Geistes",NF|||All I Have (Deutsche Übersetzung)|||139,0,approval,curiosity,confusion,"[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8431918621063232}, {'label': 'approval', 'score': 0.05802958458662033}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.048984188586473465}, {'label': 'confusion', 'score': 0.039160195738077164}, {'label': 'realization', 'score': 0.016509035602211952}, {'label': 'annoyance', 'score': 0.01371121034026146}]"
