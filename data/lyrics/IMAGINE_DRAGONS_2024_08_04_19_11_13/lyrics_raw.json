stories and she's heard fables\nThat I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables\nThis young reporter I did adore\nSo I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before\nShe said \"damn fly guy I'm in love with you\"\nThe Casanova legend must have been true\nI said by the way baby what's your name\nSaid \"I go by the name of Lois Lane\"\nAnd you could be my boyfriend you surely can\nJust let me

you need a man who's got finesse\nAnd his whole name across his chest\nHe may be able to fly all through the night\nBut can he rock a party 'til the early light\nHe can't satisfy you with his little worm\nBut I can bust you out with my super sperm\nI go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it\nAn I'm here and I'm there I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere\nJust throw your hands up in the
