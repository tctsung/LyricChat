good?\nI mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed\nAnd the chicken tastes like wood\nSo you try to play it off like you think you can\nBy saying that you're full\nAnd then your friend says \"momma, he's just being polite\nHe ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull\"\nSo your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie\nAnd you say that you already ate\nAnd your friend says \"man there's plenty of food\"\nSo you pile some more on your plate\nWhile the stinky food's steaming your mind starts to dreaming\nOf the moment that it's time to leave\nAnd then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting\nInto something that looks like cheese\nOh so you say that's it I got to leave this place\nI don't care what these people think\nI'm just sitting here making myself nauseous\nWith this ugly food that stinks\nSo you bust out the door while its still closed\nStill sick from the food you ate\nAnd then you run to the store for quick relief\nFrom a bottle of kaopectate\nAnd then you call your friend two weeks later\nTo see how he has been\nAnd he says \"I understand about the food\nBaby but bubba, we're still friends\"\n\nWith a hip hop the hippie the hippie\nTo the hip hip hop and you don't stop\nThe rock it to the bang bang boogie\nSay up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat..",
