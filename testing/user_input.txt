I'm high as F now. I took some crazy drugs. I'm seeing colors everywhere. This trip is wild
I feel like I'm floating in space right now
What is your name?
How to you work to give me songs
Can you tell me a joke?
I'm feeling great! Super duper good. Everything's going my way
If I were a superhero, I'd be Captain Awesome!
Life is awesome today! I can't stop smiling
I couldn't find a job. I don't feel like believing in myself anymore
I just don't see the point in trying anymore
Blah blah blah... just whatever
Dkljfndsfjs. What do you think? I dunno. Maybe, maybe not.
You know what time it is? It's time to buy a unicorn!
I miss the days when I used to ride my bike around the neighborhood until the streetlights came on
I still remember the first time I watched The Lion King. I can still feel the magic
I miss those big family dinners at grandma's house. The food, the laughterâ€”everything was perfect
